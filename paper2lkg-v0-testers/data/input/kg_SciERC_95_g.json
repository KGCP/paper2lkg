  "summary": "This paper deals with the problem of generating the fundamental frequency -LRB- F0 -RRB- contour of speech from a text input for text-to-speech synthesis . We have previously introduced a statistical model describing the generating process of speech F0 contours , based on the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model . One remarkable feature of this model is that it has allowed us to derive an efficient algorithm based on powerful statistical methods for estimating the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours . To associate a sequence of the Fujisaki-model parameters with a text input based on statistical learning , this paper proposes extending this model to a context-dependent one . We further propose a parameter training algorithm for the present model based on a decision tree-based context clustering .",
