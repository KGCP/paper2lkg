Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem , we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an efficient search algorithm . A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented . The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task -LRB- German-English , 8000-word vocabulary -RRB- , which is a limited-domain spoken-language task .",
