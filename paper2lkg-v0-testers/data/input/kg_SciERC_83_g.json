  "summary": "In this paper we present our recent work on harvesting English-Chinese bitexts of the laws of Hong Kong from the Web and aligning them to the subparagraph level via utilizing the numbering system in the legal text hierarchy . Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail . The resultant bilingual corpus , 10.4 M English words and 18.3 M Chinese characters , is an authoritative and comprehensive text collection covering the specific and special domain of HK laws . It is particularly valuable to empirical MT research . This piece of work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting English-Chinese bitexts in a larger volume from the Web .",
