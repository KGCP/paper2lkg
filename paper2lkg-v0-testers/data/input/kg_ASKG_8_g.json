  "summary": "Key developments in wearable sensors, wireless networks, and distributed computing will largely enable Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) as a powerful, natural and intuitive mainstream human-computer interaction in real-world activities. BCI systems annotate the sensed signals in order to classify the analysis of brain states and dynamics in diverse daily-life circumstances. There is no complete and standardized formal semantic structure to model the BCI metadata annotations, which are essential to capture the descriptive and predictive features of the brain signals.\n\nWe present the BCI Ontology (BCI-O): the first OWL 2 ontology that formalizes relevant metadata for BCI data capture activities by integrating BCI-domain-specific Sense and Actuation Models along with a novel Context Model for describing any kind of real or virtual environments. At its core, BCI-O defines a human-environment interaction model for any BCI, based on design patterns and primarily aligned to the SOSA/SSN, SAN-IoT-O, and DUL ontologies. Its axiomatizations aid BCI systems to implement an ontological overlay upon vast data recording collections to support semantic query constructions to perform Adaptive BCI and reasoning for situation-specific data analytics to apply inference rules for Transfer Learning in multimodal classification.\n\nBrain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are systems that analyze neuro-physiological signals like EEG to determine brain states and actuate responses, often using Machine Learning techniques. A project under the U.S. Army Research Laboratory involved the Pervasive Embedding Technologies Lab and the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience to develop a BCI Ontology for identifying cognitive states and facilitating Transfer Learning. The project created metadata vocabularies, EEG Study Schema (ESS) and Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED), leading to the development of an ontological structure for BCI experiments. BCI-O aims to process neuro-physiological data for feature extraction and classification, aligning with W3C frameworks and IoT ontologies. A key contribution was integrating context into BCI-O, acknowledging that biological signals are context-dependent. The paper details BCI metadata, design principles, and future work.\n\nReal-world multimodal BCI involves using sensors and actuators for human-environment interaction during activities, with contextual stimuli recorded in BCI data. BCI-O defines a bidirectional interaction model comprising a Sense Model (context to subject) and an Actuation Model (subject to context), based on specific ontologies. It includes two domains: the BCI domain (observations and interactions) and the context domain (surroundings), with concepts derived from the Unity framework and various standard vocabularies. Key formats include Extensible Data Format (XDF) for multi-channel data and EEG Study Schema (ESS) for electrophysiological studies. After data collection, systems annotate it with descriptive and predictive parameters for adaptive BCI. The ontology aims to define core BCI concepts, develop a machine-readable semantic model for interoperability, and ensure simplicity and reusability. The BCI-O framework is extendable for BCI system implementations.\n\nBCI-O concepts are organized into modules that explain key aspects of the BCI interaction model. The Subject represents a person with attributes, akin to a Patient in HL7. Context describes the environment through scenes of interacting entities, linking stimuli, actions, and effects. A Session captures the interaction between a subject and context during an activity. The Sense Model details input data and observations, while Sensors relate to devices and their specifications. System Capabilities focus on data structure models, and Results encompass recorded data and actuation outcomes. The Actuation Model illustrates how subjects interact with contexts. Annotation Tags mark events and responses for predictive features, while Descriptors provide external resources for entity descriptions. EEG concepts cover subtypes for channels and devices, allowing interoperability in BCI systems. The specification allows flexibility in handling measurement units and extending procedures.\n\nThe Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and its core ontology SOSA provide a framework that BCI-O extends for the BCI domain, offering a structure for Sense and Actuation Models. The Sense Model utilizes SSN to enhance semantic interoperability in BCI systems, connecting IoT and the Internet of Services. It describes sensor networks as Web applications and employs the Stimulus-Sensor-Observation (SSO) design pattern for observation-related ontologies. The Actuation Model is based on bci:Actuation and bci:Actuator, integrating the Semantic Actuator Network (SAN) and following the Actuation-Actuator-Effect (AAE) design pattern. BCI-O's design approach features a three-layered ontology architecture, aligning foundational, core, and domain layers. The Context Model is based on Unity's gaming architecture, which organizes entities and relationships from structural, behavioral, and temporal perspectives, ensuring consistency with DUL.\n\nA proto-ontology was developed under the CaN-CTA Program for a BCI system, focusing on BCI and physical/virtual environments. The modeling process involved identifying major players and flows, formalizing characterizations, and defining common concepts. A hybrid modeling style was employed, utilizing verbal, logic-based, and structural-object approaches. Ontology authoring followed best practices from SSN and IoT-O, with a focus on relevant BCI metadata terms and class hierarchies. Popular vocabularies like Dublin Core and SKOS enriched the BCI-O concepts. Satisfiability was checked using the HermiT reasoner, and three versions of specifications were developed: Base, HTML, and OWL 2 RDF/XML. A linked data engine was created for serving specifications, and the BCI-O was published in the LOV registry on November 8, 2016.\n\nThe BCI-O proto-ontology was developed by NCTU and UCSD, with the U.S. ARL Translational Neuroscience Branch, to enable semantic search in large BCI datasets. It has been applied in various contexts, including neuroimaging for stress and fatigue, driving tests, and VR/AR goggle applications. The HTML version of BCI-O includes two applications: the CerebraTek vPod Ontology for glaucoma diagnostics and the ESS+HED Standards Ontology for EEG data sharing. These tools support machine learning model training using semi-structured metadata. A use case demonstrates BCI-O's role in transfer learning, where a semantic query selects high-correlation EEG data segments for a more advanced CNN model, RevNet+I, based on categorized observations from 100 glaucoma patients. The semantic query includes sections for semantic matching, query restrictions, model selection, and query projection. Overall, BCI-O enhances BCI systems by modeling subject-independent features and providing relevant datasets for personalized model calibration.\n\nBCI-O models subject-context interactions while focusing on monitoring the brain dynamics. In the long term, we would like to take BCI-O as the basis towards generalizing a semantic model to describe how any human body bio-signal, not only from the brain, can be monitored and made to interact with computing interfaces. Initially, this work would lead to BCI-O's generalization towards a Bio-signal Computer-Interaction Ontology. This modeling task is planned to be one of the main development drivers in the future for a set of ontological frameworks to capture the different bio-signal markers and technological interfaces for the entire human body: organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and systems including nervous, integumentary, and endocrine.\n\nAdditionally, there is an ongoing effort on proposing some extensions to the SOSA/SSN W3C Recommendation. We are following closely the new proposed concepts and relationships and providing our feedback from the BCI-O perspective in their ongoing discussions, with special interest for issue #1028 regarding the Homogeneity of an Observation Collection. BCI-O will be updated accordingly following the structure and alignments of these extensions after the proposal becomes stable. Lastly, some BCI applications keep part of their metadata stored in standard relational database systems. As an aside project, we are planning to work on an OWL 2 QL profile version of BCI-O, so that those relevant metadata sets can be queried through a restrictive version of BCI-O.\n\nAs a foundational model for real-world BCI, BCI-O will become an important tool to aid large-scale BCI data analytics models and processes, due primarily to its OWL 2 formal structure. Semantic reasoning based tasks of BCI-O's axiomatizations enable BCI systems to carry out two major jobs: first, to apply inference rules to aid machine learning techniques, such as feature-based transfer learning in online multimodal EEG classification, and second, to perform Adaptive BCI, which involves training and refining brain state prediction and classification models based on relevant data sets constructed through semantic data queries.\n\nAnother key contribution of BCI-O is its novel Context Model. This model associates the context architectonic definition with the data recordings, making BCI systems semantically context-aware for real and virtual-world situations. Thus, it provides a semantic foundation for augmented BCI, assisting ambient intelligence settings in sensor systems for any kind of BCI. As a domain ontology for BCI sensors and actuators, BCI-O allows for semantically informed BCI analytics of sensor and actuator data patterns, including unambiguous searchability, similarities, simulations, and predictions, as well as semantic interoperability based on its alignments. This enables easy integration, reusability, and extensibility into the Linked Data world for all kinds of BCI. In general, its axiomatizations enable BCI systems to apply Semantic Web technologies for data analysis, serving as a form of semantic middleware for BCI sensor and actuator networks.",
