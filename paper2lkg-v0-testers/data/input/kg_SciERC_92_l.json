  "summary": "We propose a novel step toward the unsupervised seg-mentation of whole objects by combining '' hints '' of partial scene segmentation offered by multiple soft , binary mattes . These mattes are implied by a set of hypothesized object boundary fragments in the scene . Rather than trying to find or define a single '' best '' segmentation , we generate multiple segmentations of an image . This reflects contemporary methods for unsupervised object discovery from groups of images , and it allows us to define intuitive evaluation met-rics for our sets of segmentations based on the accurate and parsimonious delineation of scene objects . Our proposed approach builds on recent advances in spectral clustering , image matting , and boundary detection . It is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively on a dataset of scenes and is suitable for current work in unsupervised object discovery without top-down knowledge .",
