But computational linguists seem to be quite dubious about analogies between sentences : they would not be enough numerous to be of any use . We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains . We give two estimates , a lower one and a higher one . As an analogy must be valid on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning , we relied on the idea that translation should preserve meaning to test for similar meanings .",
