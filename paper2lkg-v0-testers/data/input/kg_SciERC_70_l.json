  "summary": "In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse . In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them . The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds . The attentional state , being dynamic , records the objects , properties , and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions . The theory of attention , intention , and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses . Various properties of discourse are described , and explanations for the behaviour of cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions are explored . This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse . Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments , recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions , and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state . This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants ' knowledge of the domain .",
