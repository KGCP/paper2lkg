  "summary": "We propose a novel approach to associate objects across multiple PTZ cameras that can be used to perform camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios . While previous approaches relied on geometric , appearance , or correlation-based information for establishing correspondences between static cameras , they each have well-known limitations and are not extendable to wide-area settings with PTZ cameras . In our approach , the slave camera only passively follows the target -LRB- by loose registration with the master -RRB- and bootstraps itself from its own incoming imagery , thus effectively circumventing the problems faced by previous approaches and avoiding the need to perform any model transfer . Towards this goal , we also propose a novel Multiple Instance Learning -LRB- MIL -RRB- formulation for the problem based on the logistic softmax function of covariance-based region features within a MAP estimation framework . We demonstrate our approach with multiple PTZ camera sequences in typical outdoor surveillance settings and show a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches .",
