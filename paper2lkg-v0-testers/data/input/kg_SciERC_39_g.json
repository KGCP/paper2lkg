  "summary": "This paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems . We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use , e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval . This raises questions about the validity of such approaches . In the second half of the paper , we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task . We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique , place upon a prototype Natural Language system . We identify three important requirements which arose from the task that we gave our subjects : operators specific to the task of database access , complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source . We discuss how these might be satisfied by future Natural Language systems .",
