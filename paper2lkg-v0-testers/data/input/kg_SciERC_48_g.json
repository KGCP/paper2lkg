  "summary": "We investigate the problem of learning to predict moves in the board game of Go from game records of expert players . In particular , we obtain a probability distribution over legal moves for professional play in a given position . This distribution has numerous applications in computer Go , including serving as an efficient stand-alone Go player . It would also be effective as a move selector and move sorter for game tree search and as a training tool for Go players . Our method has two major components : a -RRB- a pattern extraction scheme for efficiently harvesting patterns of given size and shape from expert game records and b -RRB- a Bayesian learning algorithm -LRB- in two variants -RRB- that learns a distribution over the values of a move given a board position based on the local pattern context . The system is trained on 181,000 expert games and shows excellent prediction performance as indicated by its ability to perfectly predict the moves made by professional Go players in 34 % of test positions .",
