  "summary": "An important area of learning in autonomous agents is the ability to learn domain-speciic models of actions to be used by planning systems . In this paper , we present methods by which an agent learns action models from its own experience and from its observation of a domain expert . These methods diier from previous work in the area in two ways : the use of an action model formalism which is better suited to the needs of a re-active agent , and successful implementation of noise-handling mechanisms . Training instances are generated from experience and observation , and a variant of GOLEM is used to learn action models from these instances . The integrated learning system has been experimentally validated in simulated construction and ooce domains .",
