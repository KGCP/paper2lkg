 "question": "What is the primary purpose of the BCI Ontology (BCI-O) as described in the paper?",
 "answer": "The primary purpose of the BCI Ontology (BCI-O) is to formalize relevant metadata for BCI data capture activities by integrating BCI-domain-specific Sense and Actuation Models along with a novel Context Model for describing any kind of real/virtual environments."
 },
 {
 "question": "Which upper ontologies is BCI-O aligned with according to the paper?",
 "answer": "BCI-O is aligned with the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) upper ontologies."
 },
 {
 "question": "What are the two distinct conceptual domains found in the BCI-O interaction model?",
 "answer": "The two distinct conceptual domains are the BCI domain (observations, actuations, and interactions) and the context domain (surroundings)."
 },
 {
 "question": "What does the bci:Session concept represent in the BCI-O?",
 "answer": "The bci:Session concept represents the interaction between a bci:Subject and a bci:Context while performing a single bci:Activity, grouping both observations (multimodal records: bci:Record) and actuations (bci:Actuation)."
 },
 {
 "question": "What are the three key concepts defined under the bci:Context.Event classification in BCI-O?",
 "answer": "The three key concepts are bci:StimulusEvent (a stimulus to the bci:Subject), bci:Action (issued by a bci:Subject while performing a bci:Activity), and bci:ActuationEvent (an effect -change of state- in bci:Context as the result of bci:Actuation)."
 },
 {
 "question": "What is the role of the bci:ActuationEvent in the BCI-O?",
 "answer": "The bci:ActuationEvent represents a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one: actuation target) ─ a modification (impacted property, as a consequence of an actuation effect) ─ in the context as the result of an actuation (actuation result involves actuation event)."
 },
 {
 "question": "What is the relationship between bci:Actuation and sosa:Actuation according to the paper?",
 "answer": "The bci:Actuation is aligned to both sosa:Actuation and san:Actuation, meaning it integrates and reconciles SOSA and SAN axioms for modeling actuations and actuators."
 },
 {
 "question": "What does the bci:ActuationTarget concept capture in the BCI-O?",
 "answer": "The bci:ActuationTarget concept captures the definition of sosa:FeatureOfInterest, representing the thing (actuation target) whose property (impacted property) is being manipulated by an actuator."
 },
 {
 "question": "What is the function of an actuator as described in the BCI-O?",
 "answer": "An actuator is a device that is used by, or implements, an actuation that changes the state of the context, transforming an input signal into a physical output."
 },
 {
 "question": "What is the main contribution of the BCI-O's Actuation Model to the IoT and BCI communities?",
 "answer": "The main contribution of the BCI-O's Actuation Model is its structure, which includes contextual notions that enable its usage in context-aware BCI-IoT integrated applications, representing a major contribution to the IoT and BCI communities."
