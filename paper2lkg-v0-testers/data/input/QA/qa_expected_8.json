    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the BCI Ontology (BCI-O) as described in the paper?",
    "answer": "The primary purpose of the BCI Ontology (BCI-O) is to formalize relevant metadata for BCI data capture activities by integrating BCI-domain-specific Sense and Actuation Models along with a novel Context Model for describing any kind of real or virtual environments."
    },
    {
    "question": "Which ontologies are primarily aligned with the BCI-O for its Sense and Actuation Models?",
    "answer": "The BCI-O is primarily aligned with the SOSA/SSN, SAN-IoT-O, and DUL ontologies for its Sense and Actuation Models."
    },
    {
    "question": "What are the two sets of metadata vocabulary developed by the SCCN team mentioned in the paper?",
    "answer": "The two sets of metadata vocabulary developed by the SCCN team are the EEG Study Schema (ESS) and the Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED)."
    },
    {
    "question": "What is the role of the Context Model in BCI-O?",
    "answer": "The Context Model in BCI-O captures the architectural description of a physical or virtual environment, based on a sequence of scenes, each depicting a collection of spatially located entities interacting with one another in a specific way."
    },
    {
    "question": "What are the main design objectives of the BCI-O?",
    "answer": "The main design objectives of the BCI-O are: defining core, generic, and relevant consensual concepts about BCI data capture activities, developing a machine-readable BCI semantic model for software agents' interoperability, and ensuring simplicity, extensibility, and reusability."
    },
    {
    "question": "What is the significance of the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) in the development of BCI-O's Sense Model?",
    "answer": "The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) provides the conceptual template and structure for BCI-O's Sense Model, describing functional aspects of any BCI data capture activity and improving semantic interoperability and integration of BCI systems."
    },
    {
    "question": "How does the BCI-O support Transfer Learning in BCI systems?",
    "answer": "BCI-O supports Transfer Learning in BCI systems by enabling semantic query constructions to perform Adaptive BCI and reasoning for situation-specific data analytics, applying inference rules for Transfer Learning in multimodal classification."
    },
    {
    "question": "What is the basis of the Context Model in BCI-O?",
    "answer": "The Context Model in BCI-O is based on relevant abstractions curated from the gaming architectural modeling of the Unity framework."
    },
    {
    "question": "What are the key concepts defined under the event classification in BCI-O?",
    "answer": "The key concepts defined under the event classification in BCI-O are: a stimulus to the subject, an action issued by a subject while performing an activity, and an effect in the context as the result of an actuation."
    },
    {
    "question": "What future work is planned for BCI-O according to the paper?",
    "answer": "Future work for BCI-O includes generalizing the ontology towards a Bio-signal Computer-Interaction Ontology, proposing extensions to the SOSA/SSN W3C Recommendation, and developing an OWL 2 QL profile version of BCI-O for querying metadata stored in standard relational database systems."
