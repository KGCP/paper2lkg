  "question": "What is the primary purpose of the MEL tool as described in the abstract?",
  "answer": "The primary purpose of the MEL tool is to extract metadata and content-based information from unstructured information encoded in different source document formats, aiding pre-processing tasks as part of a Knowledge Graph Construction Pipeline (KGCP)."
  },
  {
  "question": "What file format does MEL generate as output?",
  "answer": "MEL generates JSON files as output."
  },
  {
  "question": "Which toolkit is MEL integrated with for the extraction of categorised named entities?",
  "answer": "MEL is integrated with 'The NLP -NER Toolkit' (TNNT) for the extraction of categorised named entities."
  },
  {
  "question": "What are the three main steps in MEL's metadata and content extraction process?",
  "answer": "The three main steps are: (1) taking as input a document set, (2) extracting metadata and content-based information for each document while performing basic text analysis, and (3) generating a JSON file with the extracted metadata and text content."

  {
  "question": "On which operating systems can OLE 2 file types and .docm files be processed by MEL?",
  "answer": "OLE 2 file types and .docm files can only be processed on Windows operating systems."
  },
  {
  "question": "What does MEL use for the 'General-Metadata' extraction task?",
  "answer": "MEL optionally uses the XML output from the NLNZ Metadata Extractor tool for the 'General-Metadata' extraction task."
  },
  {
  "question": "What is the main difference between MEL and Apache Tika?",
  "answer": "The main difference is that MEL is a lightweight Python-based package aimed at metadata extraction for common file formats in a KGCP, whereas Apache Tika is a complex Java-based general-purpose system."
  },
  {
  "question": "What future work is planned for MEL regarding its integration with ontologies?",
  "answer": "Future work includes exploring the addition of a vocabulary or light-weight ontology using JSON-LD annotations to make the extracted metadata 'RDF ready'."
  },
  {
  "question": "How many different file types does MEL support?",
  "answer": "MEL supports more than 20 different file types."
  },
  {
  "question": "What is the significance of the JSON result files generated by MEL?",
  "answer": "The JSON result files generated by MEL can easily be mapped to RDF using tools such as J2RM, facilitating their use in automated KGCPs."
