  {
  "question": "What is the main goal of TNNT as introduced in the paper?",
  "answer": "The main goal of TNNT is to automate the extraction of categorised named entities from unstructured information encoded in source documents using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) NLP-NER tools and models."
  },
  {
  "question": "How many different NER models does TNNT integrate?",
  "answer": "TNNT integrates 21 different NER models."
  },
  {
  "question": "What is the role of the 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT?",
  "answer": "MEL enables the extraction of metadata and content-based information from various file formats such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip."
  },
  {
  "question": "What types of file formats can TNNT process through MEL?",
  "answer": "TNNT can process file formats including .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip."
  },
  {
  "question": "What are the four motivations behind the development of TNNT?",
  "answer": "The motivations are: (1) to easily pre-process documents for NER analysis, (2) to easily use documents with different formats for NER analysis, (3) to hide usage variations across NER models and NLP tools and bring them under one uniform pipeline, and (4) to provide a framework for analysing results from different NER models and NLP tools."
  },
  {
  "question": "What kind of information does TNNT retrieve for each recognised entity?",
  "answer": "For each recognised entity, TNNT retrieves context information, start/end indices in the document text, and statistics of the entities identified by each model for respective categories along with start/end timestamps and the duration taken by the models to run the NER task."
  },
  {
  "question": "What additional processing layers does TNNT's RESTful API provide?",
  "answer": "TNNT's RESTful API provides additional processing layers such as POS tagging, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, aggregations, descriptive stats, and browsing capabilities."
  },
  {
  "question": "What are the major contributions of TNNT as stated in the conclusion?",
  "answer": "The major contributions are: (1) the ability to process different source document formats for NER; (2) the availability of 21 different SOTA NER models integrated into one system, enabling easy selection of models for NER; (3) the provision of an integrated summary of the results from different models; and (4) a RESTful API that enables easy access to NLP tasks that enrich the NER results from the models."
  },
  {
  "question": "What project was TNNT tested under as part of its development?",
  "answer": "TNNT was tested as part of the 'Australian Government Records Interoperability Framework' (AGRIF) project."
  },
  {
  "question": "What does TNNT generate for each processed source document?",
  "answer": "TNNT generates JSON files for each processed source document, which include the list of models, categories, and identified entities."
