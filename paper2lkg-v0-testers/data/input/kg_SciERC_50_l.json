  "summary": "Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices , with applications in signal processing and machine learning . We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real , but we only observe a set M ' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M . Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M ' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M . The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M ' and the noise level . In particular , it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer , such as its proximity to critical points , that are typical of existing bounds in the literature . To our knowledge , this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition . We demonstrate the bound on synthetic data for which the ground truth is known .",
