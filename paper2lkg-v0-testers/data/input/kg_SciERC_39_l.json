  "summary": "This paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems . We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use , e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval . This raises questions about the validity of such approaches . In the second half of the paper , we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task . We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique , place upon a prototype Natural Language system . We identify three important requirements which arose from the task that we gave our subjects : operators specific to the task of database access , complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source . We discuss how these might be satisfied by future Natural Language systems .",

      "label": "have neglected to evaluate",
      "description": "To 'have neglected to evaluate' means to intentionally or unintentionally overlook or disregard the evaluation of something (the object), often resulting from a lack of attention, consideration, or effort. This predicate implies that the subject has failed to assess or examine the object thoroughly, leading to potential consequences such as missed opportunities, misunderstandings, or suboptimal decisions.",

    "Predicate-evaluate": {
      "label": "evaluate",
      "description": "To evaluate means to assess or judge the quality, value, or significance of something. It implies a critical examination and consideration of the object's characteristics, merits, or flaws in order to form an opinion or make a decision about it.",

    "Predicate-arose_from": {
      "label": "arose from",
      "description": "The predicate 'arose from' indicates a causal relationship between the subject and object. It suggests that the subject (e.g., requirements, ideas, problems) emerged or originated as a direct result of the object (e.g., task, situation, context). In general, this predicate implies a sense of derivation, emergence, or development.",

      "label": "require data retrieval",
      "description": "The predicate 'require data retrieval' indicates that a subject entity needs to access or obtain specific information from an external source. This implies that the subject lacks this information internally and must retrieve it through some means, such as querying databases, scraping websites, or processing sensor feeds.",

    },
    "Predicate-arose": {
      "label": "arose",
      "description": "The predicate 'arose' indicates a causal or explanatory relationship between the subject and object. It suggests that the object (three important requirements which arose from...) has its origin, source, or explanation in the subject (We identify three important requirements).",

      "label": "emerged from",
      "description": "The predicate 'emerged from' indicates a relationship where something (the subject) has originated or developed from another thing (the object), often implying a process of growth, transformation, or discovery. This connection suggests that the subject's existence, identity, or characteristics are rooted in or derived from the object.",

    "Predicate-report": {
      "label": "report",
      "description": "To report means to present or convey information about a particular topic, situation, or finding.

    },
    "skos:broader": {
      "label": "has a broader term",
      "description": "Indicates that the subject concept is a more specific instance of the object concept. The predicate 'has a broader term' establishes a hierarchical relationship between two concepts, where the subject is a narrower or more specialized version of the object.",
