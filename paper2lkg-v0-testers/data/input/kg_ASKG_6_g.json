  "summary": "Enterprise and public Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, and while traditional rule-based methods learn closed rules, we introduce Open Path (OP) rules, which are existentially constrained. Our novel algorithm, OPRL, learns OP rules and generates relevant queries for KG completion, even in the absence of closed rules. To enhance scalability, we propose an embedding-based fitness function and efficient vector computation for assessing rule quality. Evaluations on Freebase, YAGO2, Wikidata, and a synthetic Poker KG show that OPRL can mine hundreds of accurate rules from KGs with up to 8 million facts, achieving query precision of 98% and recall of 62%, marking a significant advancement in active knowledge graph completion.\n\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) are effective for modeling large amounts of weakly-structured data, allowing flexible information addition unlike relational databases. However, KGs often lack comprehensive coverage of entities and relationships, similar to Wikipedia's uneven topic coverage. Techniques for KG completion and rule learning have been developed to automate curation, using models to predict missing facts. This paper introduces a novel approach to rule-based KG completion that identifies unknown unknowns by learning open path rules (OP) to generate open-ended questions instead of specific facts. OP rules can infer missing facts even when entities are absent from the KG, facilitating the introduction of new entities. The proposed method complements traditional link prediction by generating relevant queries needed for KG completion. The paper presents an algorithm, OPRL, for learning OP rules and demonstrates its effectiveness in generating queries that can help complete KGs. The structure of the paper includes foundational concepts, the OP rule formalism, the OPRL method, query generation, and related literature.\n\nRule-Based KG Completion involves entities as identifiers for objects and facts as RDF triples relating these entities. Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of entities and facts. Rule learning systems like RLVLR and ScaleKB use closed path (CP) rules, which have a head and a body, to infer new facts from existing ones in the KG. The effectiveness of rules is measured by support, standard confidence (SC), and head coverage (HC). Representation learning methods model KGs for tasks like link prediction by embedding entities and predicates into a latent space. Two main types of embeddings are translation-based and compositional embeddings. RESCAL, a compositional-based learner, captures complex interactions among entities and predicates, making it suitable for mining operational rules due to its effective heuristic function.\n\nIn our active knowledge graph completion task, we mine open path (OP) rules, which take the form: P_t(x, z_0) \u2190 P_1(z_0, z_1) \u2227 P_2(z_1, z_2) \u2227 ... \u2227 P_n(z_{n-1}, y). OP rules differ from closed path (CP) rules as they can be linear and are more expressive, allowing instantiations not possible with CP rules. From an OP rule, we can only infer questions, not facts. For example, the rule citizenOf(x, t) \u2190 livesIn(x, z) implies that if x lives in z, then x is a citizen of somewhere (t). To evaluate OP rules, we define open path standard confidence (OPSC) and open path head coverage (OPHC). The support degree of an OP rule is calculated based on the entities satisfying its body and head. For instance, for the rule P_1(x, z_0) \u2190 P_2(z_0, z_1) \u2227 P_3(z_1, y), if 3 entities satisfy the body and 5 satisfy the head, we find OPsupp = 3, OPSC = 3/7, and OPHC = 3/5.\n\nThe goal is to mine a Knowledge Graph (KG) for high-quality OP rules related to a target predicate P. We enhance the RLVLR architecture by introducing a novel fitness function to assess OP rule quality based on predicate embeddings and a vector computation method for evaluating these rules against large KGs. Our OP rule miner, OPRL, takes user-defined parameters for rule length and quality scores. We first reduce the KG size using a sampling algorithm to focus on entities relevant to P, creating a reduced KG K'. We compute embeddings for predicates and arguments to construct a fitness function that improves scalability. The PathFinding() method generates OP rules for P and its inverse, while IncPathFinding() extends top-ranked rules. We ensure no redundancy in mined rules and evaluate them using OPSC and OPHC metrics, employing efficient matrix and vector multiplication for scalability.\n\nTo manage potential rules in PathFinding(), we filter low-quality candidates using two fitness functions: co-occurrence and open path, based on embedding representations. The co-occurrence function evaluates predicates by shared entities, while the open path function connects them through predicate chains. CP rules are simpler to compute than OP rules due to fewer variables. Argument embeddings are averaged from subject and object entities. Co-occurrence fitness for OP rules is defined through local pairwise functions, and open path fitness uses the product of predicate embeddings. Both functions are complementary, and a hybrid approach selects the top candidate rules.\n\nThe Evaluation() method in Algorithm 1 assesses candidate rules from a sampled KG for efficiency, selecting those with OPsupp(r) \u2265 1 and filtering out obsolete rules using OPSC and OPHC metrics. The KG is represented as square adjacency matrices for efficient computation, checking satisfiability of body atoms to identify KG facts that trigger rules. Minimum thresholds for OPSC and OPHC are set at runtime, discarding non-compliant rules. The method introduces components for mining OP rules, including function-free Horn rules and a rapid rule quality estimation method.\n\nWe can mine OP rules from KGs to generate queries for Active Knowledge Graph Completion (AKGC). The task involves creating queries like P(?, e') and P(e, ?) using predicate P. An inference module derives these queries from KG facts and OP rules learned via OPRL, with the confidence degree (CD) defined as the maximum OPSC of the inducing rules. The challenge in industrial applications is generating valuable queries without hold-out facts. For AKGC, we use OP rules over training data to induce relevant queries across the knowledge base, focusing on mining OP rules to predict queries rather than relying solely on link predictors.\n\nWe conducted experiments to evaluate OPRL, focusing on generating relevant questions for knowledge graph completion rather than answering them. Our approach assumes a perfect link predictor to assess question relevancy based on test facts. As the first method to automatically generate relevant questions, we compared OPRL against two baselines: a probabilistic query generator and a modified rule-based link predictor. Our findings show that OPRL effectively mines quality OP rules from various KGs, demonstrating superior recall and precision in generated queries compared to the baselines. We tested our system on four benchmark datasets, including FB15K SELECTED and YAGO2 core, and utilized a synthetic poker dataset for experiments. All tests were performed on a high-performance server, with specific parameters set for rule mining and embeddings.\n\nThe study evaluates the effectiveness of OPRL in discovering high-quality rules, comparing its performance with proposed fitness functions. Rule quality is assessed using OPSC/OPHC scores against full benchmark KGs. For query evaluation, hold-out facts are needed; FB15KSE has available test and training sets, while Poker and YAGO2 core data is randomly split 90% for training and 10% for testing. Table 2 presents the average number of quality rules mined across predicates, with Wikidata being an exception. OPRL successfully learns plausible rules from large KGs in under two hours. Examples of mined rules from Wikidata illustrate their utility. An experiment using random predicates from FB15KSE indicates that a hybrid fitness function outperforms individual functions in mining quality rules.\n\nThe experiments evaluate the relevance of queries generated from OPRL-mined rules, considering a query relevant if it has an answer in the test set. Three baseline query sets, Prand, were created for comparison. OPRL outperformed Prand on FB15KSE, YAGO2 core, and Poker by factors of approximately 6, 2, and 9, respectively. YAGO2's weaker performance is attributed to fewer repeatable patterns and potentially more missing facts. In synthetic Poker, high precision and recall were observed, indicating relevant queries were generated. The sensitivity of OPRL performance to the OPSC threshold was analyzed, revealing a drop in recall and an anomaly at OPSC 0.9 due to FB15KSE's incompleteness. OPRL was compared to RLvLR, a state-of-the-art link predictor, by translating RLvLR-generated facts into queries. Adjustments to RLvLR's aggregation method improved its performance, but OPRL still showed superior query generation, with a partial AUC of 0.30 compared to RLvLR's 0.23.\n\nPrevious work in rule learning from knowledge graphs primarily focuses on Closed rules, which are less expressive than our OP rules. While OP rule learners generate new facts, our goal is to create relevant queries for these facts. There have been initial efforts to learn existential rules from knowledge graphs, but no learning system has been proposed. We have not found any prior methods that generate relevant queries for link predictors in knowledge graph completion. CHAI filters facts to enhance prediction by focusing on probable facts, but it does not generate queries like OPRL and relies heavily on the initial set of facts.\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a method for learning rules with free variables from Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Such rules can be used to generate queries soliciting missing facts. Notably, the queries could be fed to link predictors, enabling a fully automated framework for KG completion.\n\nWe introduced the following novel components: (1) We propose OP rules, a fragment of function-free Horn rules, which allows us to mine rules with free variables while keeping the complexity of the learning phase manageable. (2) We introduced a novel method to estimate the quality of each candidate rule based on its embedding representation. (3) We proposed an efficient method to evaluate OP rules by exactly computing the quality of each rule using matrix and vector operations. (4) We showed how OP rules can be used to generate highly relevant queries for missing links, introducing the first work on active knowledge graph completion.\n\nOur experiments show that OPRL can learn rules for KGs with varying sizes and degrees of incompleteness. We demonstrate the usefulness of the mined rules by applying them to three different KGs to infer relevant queries.\n\nOur proposed method outperforms the baselines and shows its strength, especially in the complete KG, Poker, with 0.98 precision.\n\nThere remain some intriguing challenges for future work. We plan to extend OPRL to learn rules with more complex shapes, such as stars, and with numerical attributes. We plan to pair OPRL with a link predictor to form a unified framework for fully automated KG completion. We will also trial OPRL in a setting for human-curated maintenance on an enterprise KG.",
