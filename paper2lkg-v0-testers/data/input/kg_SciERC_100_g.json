  "summary": "Fast algorithms for nearest neighbor -LRB- NN -RRB- search have in large part focused on 2 distance . Here we develop an approach for 1 distance that begins with an explicit and exactly distance-preserving embedding of the points into 2 2 . We show how this can efficiently be combined with random-projection based methods for 2 NN search , such as locality-sensitive hashing -LRB- LSH -RRB- or random projection trees . We rigorously establish the correctness of the methodology and show by experimentation using LSH that it is competitive in practice with available alternatives .",
