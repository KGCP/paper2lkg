  "summary": "Machine transliteration/back-transliteration plays an important role in many multilingual speech and language applications . In this paper , a novel framework for machine transliteration/backtransliteration that allows us to carry out direct orthographical mapping -LRB- DOM -RRB- between two different languages is presented . Under this framework , a joint source-channel transliteration model , also called n-gram transliteration model -LRB- n-gram TM -RRB- , is further proposed to model the transliteration process . We evaluate the proposed methods through several transliteration/backtransliteration experiments for English/Chinese and English/Japanese language pairs . Our study reveals that the proposed method not only reduces an extensive system development effort but also improves the transliteration accuracy significantly .",
