In this paper we present a new UV procedure with two major features : a -RRB- Confidence tests are applied to decoded string hypotheses obtained from using word and garbage models that represent OOV words and noises . Thus the ASR system is designed to deal with what we refer to as Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities . b -RRB- The UV procedure is based on three different confidence tests , two based on acoustic measures and one founded on linguistic information , applied in a hierarchical structure . Experimental results from a real telephone application on a natural number recognition task show an 50 % reduction in recognition errors with a moderate 12 % rejection rate of correct utterances and a low 1.5 % rate of false acceptance .",
