  "summary": "Recent progress in computer vision has been driven by high-capacity models trained on large datasets . Unfortunately , creating large datasets with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required . In this paper , we present an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games .",
