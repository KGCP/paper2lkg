  "summary": "The perception of transparent objects from images is known to be a very hard problem in vision . Given a single image , it is difficult to even detect the presence of transparent objects in the scene . In this paper , we explore what can be said about transparent objects by a moving observer . We show how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene . We present a novel model-based approach to recover the shapes and the poses of transparent objects from known motion . The objects can be complex in that they may be composed of multiple layers with different refractive indices . We have conducted numerous simulations to verify the practical feasibility of our algorithm . We have applied it to real scenes that include transparent objects and recovered the shapes of the objects with high accuracy .",
