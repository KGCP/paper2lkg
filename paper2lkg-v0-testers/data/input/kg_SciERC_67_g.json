  "summary": "We present a novel method for discovering parallel sentences in comparable , non-parallel corpora . We train a maximum entropy classifier that , given a pair of sentences , can reliably determine whether or not they are translations of each other . Using this approach , we extract parallel data from large Chinese , Arabic , and English non-parallel newspaper corpora . We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system . We also show that a good-quality MT system can be built from scratch by starting with a very small parallel corpus -LRB- 100,000 words -RRB- and exploiting a large non-parallel corpus . Thus , our method can be applied with great benefit to language pairs for which only scarce resources are available .",
