  "summary": "Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions . For example , nucleotides in a DNA sequence , children 's names in a given state and year , and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions . In all of these cases , we expect some form of dependency between the draws : the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides , children 's names are highly correlated from year to year , and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic . These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation . Here , we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\u00f3lya-gamma augmentation to reformu-late the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods , enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead .",
