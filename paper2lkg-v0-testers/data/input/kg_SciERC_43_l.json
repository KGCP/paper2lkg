  "summary": "This paper presents a machine learning approach to bare slice disambiguation in dialogue . We extract a set of heuristic principles from a corpus-based sample and formulate them as probabilistic Horn clauses . We then use the predicates of such clauses to create a set of domain independent features to annotate an input dataset , and run two different machine learning algorithms : SLIPPER , a rule-based learning algorithm , and TiMBL , a memory-based system . Both learners perform well , yielding similar success rates of approx 90 % . The results show that the features in terms of which we formulate our heuristic principles have significant predictive power , and that rules that closely resemble our Horn clauses can be learnt automatically from these features .",
