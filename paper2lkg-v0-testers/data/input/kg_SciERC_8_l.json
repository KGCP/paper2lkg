  "summary": "In this paper , we present an unlexicalized parser for German which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2 , higher than previously reported results on the NEGRA corpus . In addition to the high accuracy of the model , the use of smoothing in an unlexicalized parser allows us to better examine the interplay between smoothing and parsing results .",
