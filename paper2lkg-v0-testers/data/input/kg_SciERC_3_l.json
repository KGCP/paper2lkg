  "summary": "This work proposes a new research direction to address the lack of structures in traditional n-gram models . It is based on a weakly supervised dependency parser that can model speech syntax without relying on any annotated training corpus . Labeled data is replaced by a few hand-crafted rules that encode basic syntactic knowledge . Bayesian inference then samples the rules , disambiguating and combining them to create complex tree structures that maximize a discriminative model 's posterior on a target unlabeled corpus . This posterior encodes sparse se-lectional preferences between a head word and its dependents . The model is evaluated on English and Czech newspaper texts , and is then validated on French broadcast news transcriptions .",
