We present a variant of TAGs , called synchronous TAGs , which characterize correspondences between languages . The formalism 's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics represented in a logical form language , or to their translates in another natural language ; in summary , we intend it to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper . We discuss the application of synchronous TAGs to concrete examples , mentioning primarily in passing some computational issues that arise in its interpretation .",
