  "summary": "Determiners play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance , but they have often been disregarded , perhaps because it seemed more important to devise methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence , even if not in a precise way . Another problem with determiners is their inherent ambiguity . In this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .",
