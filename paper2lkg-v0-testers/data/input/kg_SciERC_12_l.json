  "summary": "In this paper we specialize the projective unifocal , bifo-cal , and trifocal tensors to the affine case , and show how the tensors obtained relate to the registered tensors encountered in previous work . This enables us to obtain an affine specialization of known projective relations connecting points and lines across two or three views . In the simpler case of affine cameras we give neccessary and sufficient constraints on the components of the trifocal tensor , together with a simple geometric interpretation . Finally , we show how the estimation of the tensors from point correspondences is achieved through factorization , and discuss the estimation from line correspondences .",
