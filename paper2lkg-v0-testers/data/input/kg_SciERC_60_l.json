  "summary": "This paper gives an overall account of a prototype natural language question answering system , called Chat-80 . Chat-80 has been designed to be both efficient and easily adaptable to a variety of applications . The system is implemented entirely in Prolog , a programming language based on logic . With the aid of a logic-based grammar formalism called extraposition grammars , Chat-80 translates English questions into the Prolog subset of logic . The resulting logical expression is then transformed by a planning algorithm into efficient Prolog , cf. query optimisation in a relational database . Finally , the Prolog form is executed to yield the answer .",
