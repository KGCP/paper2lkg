  "summary": "This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar -LRB- CCG -RRB- lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank . The fact that Turkish is an agglutinating free word order language presents a challenge for language theories . We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon , consistent with CCG principles , from a treebank which is an order of magnitude smaller than Penn WSJ .",
