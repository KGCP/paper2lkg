  "summary": "Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal , it has been very difficult to develop a unified framework for reasoning about it at a technical level , and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community . Here we suggest a formal perspective on the difficulty in finding such a unification , in the form of an impossibility theorem : for a set of three simple properties , we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three . Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting -LRB- and unavoidable -RRB- trade-offs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage , sum-of-pairs , k-means , and k-median .",
