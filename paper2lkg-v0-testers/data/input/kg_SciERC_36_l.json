  "summary": "We consider the problem of computing the Kullback-Leibler distance , also called the relative entropy , between a probabilistic context-free grammar and a probabilistic finite automaton . We show that there is a closed-form -LRB- analytical -RRB- solution for one part of the Kullback-Leibler distance , viz the cross-entropy . We discuss several applications of the result to the problem of distributional approximation of probabilistic context-free grammars by means of probabilistic finite automata .",

      "label": "computes",
      "description": "Computes refers to a process or operation that involves calculating, processing, or generating information from one or more inputs. It implies a transformation of data into a new form, often involving mathematical or logical operations.",

    "Predicate-has": {
      "label": "has",
      "description": "The predicate 'has' indicates a relationship of possession or association between the subject and object. It suggests that the subject possesses, contains, or is characterized by the properties or attributes described by the object.",

    "Predicate-is_also_called": {
      "label": "is also called",
      "description": "The predicate 'is also called' indicates a synonymic relationship between the subject and object. It suggests that the subject has an alternative name or term that is equivalent to, but not necessarily identical with, the object.",

    },
    "Predicate-and": {
      "label": "and",
      "description": "The predicate 'and' indicates a conjunction or relationship between two entities (subject and object), suggesting that they share common characteristics, properties, or features. It implies an equivalence or similarity between the subject and object, often used to describe a connection or association between abstract concepts.",

      "label": "has a solution for",

      "description": "The predicate 'is approximated by means of' indicates a relationship between two formal systems or models where one system (the subject) can be effectively replaced, simplified, or reduced to another system (the object), often for computational efficiency, analytical tractability, or theoretical insight. This connection implies that the properties and behaviors of the subject are preserved in some sense by the object, allowing for a more manageable representation or approximation.",

      "label": "has a broader term",
      "description": "The predicate 'has a broader term' indicates that the subject is a specific instance or example of a more general concept or category represented by the object. In other words, it denotes a hierarchical relationship where the subject is a narrower or more specialized version of the object.",
