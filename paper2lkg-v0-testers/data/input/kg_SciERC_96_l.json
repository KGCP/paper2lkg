  "summary": "We introduce a method to accelerate the evaluation of object detection cascades with the help of a divide-and-conquer procedure in the space of candidate regions . Compared to the exhaustive procedure that thus far is the state-of-the-art for cascade evaluation , the proposed method requires fewer evaluations of the classifier functions , thereby speeding up the search . Furthermore , we show how the recently developed efficient subwindow search -LRB- ESS -RRB- procedure -LSB- 11 -RSB- can be integrated into the last stage of our method . This allows us to use our method to act not only as a faster procedure for cascade evaluation , but also as a tool to perform efficient branch-and-bound object detection with nonlinear quality functions , in particular kernel-ized support vector machines . Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset show an acceleration of more than 50 % by our method compared to standard cascade evaluation .",

  "predicates": {
    "Predicate-introduce": {
      "label": "introduce",
      "description": "To introduce means to bring into existence or make known something that was previously unknown or unfamiliar. It implies making explicit or formalizing a concept, idea, method, or process, often in order to share it with others or facilitate its use.",

    },
    "Predicate-accelerate": {
      "label": "accelerate",
      "description": "To accelerate means to increase the speed or rate at which something occurs, typically by improving efficiency or reducing complexity. In this sense, it connects the subject and object by indicating a transformation that enables the subject to operate more quickly or effectively in relation to the object.",

    },
    "Predicate-requires_fewer_evaluations_of": {
      "label": "requires fewer evaluations of",
      "description": "The predicate 'requires fewer evaluations of' indicates a comparison between two procedures or methods in terms of the number of assessments or judgments needed to achieve a specific outcome. It suggests that one procedure (the subject) necessitates less scrutiny, analysis, or evaluation than another procedure (not specified), with respect to the object being evaluated.",
      "disambiguation_index": 0
    },
    "Predicate-act_as_a_faster_procedure_for": {
      "label": "act as a faster procedure for",
      "description": "The predicate 'act as a faster procedure for' indicates that the subject (a method or process) replaces or supplants another approach (the object), offering improved efficiency, speed, or performance. This connection highlights an alternative solution that achieves similar results but with enhanced processing capabilities.",
      "disambiguation_index": 0
    },
    "Predicate-compares_with": {
      "label": "compares with",
      "description": "The predicate 'compares with' indicates a relationship between the subject and object where the former is being evaluated or contrasted against the latter. It suggests that there is some kind of similarity, difference, or equivalence being drawn between the two entities.",
      "disambiguation_index": 0
    },
    "skos:broader": {
      "label": "has a broader term",
      "description": "Indicates that the subject concept is a specific instance or subclass of a more general category or class denoted by the object. The predicate 'has a broader term' establishes a hierarchical relationship between the subject and object, where the subject is a narrower or more specialized version of the object.",
