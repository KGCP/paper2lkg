  "summary": "Listen-Communicate-Show -LRB- LCS -RRB- is a new paradigm for human interaction with data sources . We integrate a spoken language understanding system with intelligent mobile agents that mediate between users and information sources . We have built and will demonstrate an application of this approach called LCS-Marine . Using LCS-Marine , tactical personnel can converse with their logistics system to place a supply or information request . The request is passed to a mobile , intelligent agent for execution at the appropriate database . Requestors can also instruct the system to notify them when the status of a request changes or when a request is complete . We have demonstrated this capability in several field exercises with the Marines and are currently developing applications of this technology in new domains .",
