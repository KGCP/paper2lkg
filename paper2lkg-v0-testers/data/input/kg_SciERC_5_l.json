This model is meant to account for productive rules of interpretation which are inferred from the morpho-syntactic and semantic characteristics of the nominal constituents . In particular , we make extensive use of Pustejovsky 's principles concerning the predicative information associated with nominals . We argue that it is necessary to draw a line between generalizable semantic principles and domain-specific semantic information . We explain this distinction and we show how this model may be applied to the interpretation of compounds in real texts , provided that complementary semantic information are retrieved .",
