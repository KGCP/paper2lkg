This paper describes a method for incorporating priming into an incremental probabilistic parser . Three models are compared , which involve priming of rules between sentences , within sentences , and within coordinate structures . These models simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures found in human data , and also yield a small increase in overall parsing accuracy .",
