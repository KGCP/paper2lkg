  "summary": "Person re-identification is challenging due to the large variations of pose , illumination , occlusion and camera view . Owing to these variations , the pedestrian data is distributed as highly-curved manifolds in the feature space , despite the current convolutional neural networks -LRB- CNN -RRB- 's capability of feature extraction . However , the distribution is unknown , so it is difficult to use the geodesic distance when comparing two samples . In practice , the current deep embedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test . On the other hand , the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance in the local range , combining with the graphical relationship between samples , for approximating the geodesic distance . From this point of view , selecting suitable positive -LRB- i.e. intra-class -RRB- training samples within a local range is critical for training the CNN embedding , especially when the data has large intra-class variations . In this paper , we propose a novel moderate positive sample mining method to train robust CNN for person re-identification , dealing with the problem of large variation . In addition , we improve the learning by a metric weight constraint , so that the learned metric has a better generalization ability . Experiments show that these two strategies are effective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification , and accordingly our deep model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks of person re-identification . Therefore , the study presented in this paper may be useful in inspiring new designs of deep models for person re-identification .",
