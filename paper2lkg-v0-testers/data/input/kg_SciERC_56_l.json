We introduce a novel method of shape constrained image segmentation which is based on mixtures of feature distributions for color and texture as well as probabilistic shape knowledge . The combined approach is formulated in the framework of Bayesian statistics to account for the robust-ness requirement in image understanding . Experimental evidence shows that semantically meaningful segments are inferred , even when image data alone gives rise to ambiguous segmentations .",
