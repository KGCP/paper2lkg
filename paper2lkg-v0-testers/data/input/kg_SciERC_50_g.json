  "summary": "Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices , with applications in signal processing and machine learning . We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real , but we only observe a set M ' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M . Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M ' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M . The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M ' and the noise level . In particular , it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer , such as its proximity to critical points , that are typical of existing bounds in the literature . To our knowledge , this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition . We demonstrate the bound on synthetic data for which the ground truth is known .",

      "label": "bound on",
      "description": "The predicate 'bound on' indicates a relationship where the subject is constrained, limited, or defined in relation to the object. It suggests that the subject's characteristics, behavior, or properties are influenced or determined by the object, establishing a dependency or connection that shapes the subject's nature or function.",

      "description": "The predicate establishes a relationship where the subject offers a quantitative measure that limits the maximum possible difference between an approximate method and its exact counterpart in the context of joint triangularization. This indicates that the subject serves as a theoretical framework or tool that helps assess the accuracy of the approximate joint triangularizer by providing a first-order estimate of the deviation from the exact solution.",

      "description": "The predicate 'provides an upper bound for the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization' establishes a relationship where the subject offers a limit or constraint on the possible solutions or outcomes of the object, which is the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization. This indicates that the subject serves as a theoretical or practical guideline that helps in understanding the maximum extent or performance achievable in addressing the object, thereby framing the context in which the problem can be analyzed or solved.",

      "description": "The predicate 'has a broader term' establishes a hierarchical relationship between the subject and the object, indicating that the subject is a specific instance or subset that falls under the more general category represented by the object. This relationship suggests that the object encompasses a wider range of entities or concepts than the subject, thereby providing a context in which the subject can be understood as part of a larger classification.",
