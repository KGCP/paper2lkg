  "summary": "We present a novel approach for automatically acquiring English topic signatures . Given a particular concept , or word sense , a topic signature is a set of words that tend to co-occur with it . Topic signatures can be useful in a number of Natural Language Processing -LRB- NLP -RRB- applications , such as Word Sense Disambiguation -LRB- WSD -RRB- and Text Summarisation . Our method takes advantage of the different way in which word senses are lexicalised in English and Chinese , and also exploits the large amount of Chinese text available in corpora and on the Web . We evaluated the topic signatures on a WSD task , where we trained a second-order vector cooccurrence algorithm on standard WSD datasets , with promising results .",
