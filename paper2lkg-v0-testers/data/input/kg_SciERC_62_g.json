  "summary": "The task of machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- evaluation is closely related to the task of sentence-level semantic equivalence classification . This paper investigates the utility of applying standard MT evaluation methods -LRB- BLEU , NIST , WER and PER -RRB- to building classifiers to predict semantic equivalence and entailment . We also introduce a novel classification method based on PER which leverages part of speech information of the words contributing to the word matches and non-matches in the sentence . Our results show that MT evaluation techniques are able to produce useful features for paraphrase classification and to a lesser extent entailment . Our technique gives a substantial improvement in paraphrase classification accuracy over all of the other models used in the experiments .",
