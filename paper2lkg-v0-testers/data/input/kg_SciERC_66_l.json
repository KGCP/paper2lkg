  "summary": "Manual acquisition of semantic constraints in broad domains is very expensive . This paper presents an automatic scheme for collecting statistics on cooccurrence patterns in a large corpus . To a large extent , these statistics reflect semantic constraints and thus are used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities . The scheme was implemented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools . An experiment was performed to resolve references of the pronoun `` it '' in sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus . The results of the experiment show that in most of the cases the cooccurrence statistics indeed reflect the semantic constraints and thus provide a basis for a useful disambiguation tool .",
