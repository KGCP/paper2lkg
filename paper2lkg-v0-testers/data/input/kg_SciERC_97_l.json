  "summary": "Background modeling is an important component of many vision systems . Existing work in the area has mostly addressed scenes that consist of static or quasi-static structures . When the scene exhibits a persistent dynamic behavior in time , such an assumption is violated and detection performance deteriorates . In this paper , we propose a new method for the modeling and subtraction of such scenes . Towards the modeling of the dynamic characteristics , optical flow is computed and utilized as a feature in a higher dimensional space . Inherent ambiguities in the computation of features are addressed by using a data-dependent bandwidth for density estimation using kernels . Extensive experiments demonstrate the utility and performance of the proposed approach .",
