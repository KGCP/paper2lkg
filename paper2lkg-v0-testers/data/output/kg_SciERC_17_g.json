    "This paper studies the problem of robust PCA with side information, investigating how to enhance the recovery of low rank matrices. It improves upon standard robust PCA, which addresses the same problem but lacks the incorporation of additional side information. The problem of robust PCA with side information is a broader term that encompasses both standard robust PCA and robust PCA, as well as robust principal component analysis. The proposed method in this paper effectively recovers the low rank matrix, which can be exactly recovered through this method. Additionally, robust PCA leads to recovery, and the side information of row and/or column entities could significantly aid in this process. This side information may also be utilized in various applications, with real applications demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in noisy image classification.",
    "The proposed method significantly improves the performance of robust principal component analysis (PCA), which itself is a broader term encompassing various techniques for dimensionality reduction. Robust PCA exploits the features of entities and prior structure to enhance its effectiveness, demonstrating that the incorporation of side information can lead to better recovery of low rank matrices. In fact, while standard robust PCA cannot recover certain low rank matrices, the proposed method allows for their re-coverability. The effectiveness of features is theoretically justified, showing that these additional characteristics contribute to the overall effectiveness of the method. Furthermore, the method has been shown to improve performance specifically in applications such as noisy image classification, where the presence of noise complicates the classification task. Overall, the results indicate that the integration of side information and features of entities plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of robust PCA.",
    "Noisy image classification is a specific area within the broader field of applications, which encompasses various use cases in machine learning. In this context, a data matrix is crucial as it can be decomposed into two components: the low rank part and the sparse residual. Current approaches in robust principal component analysis (robust PCA) are developed by considering the low rank plus sparse structure of data matrices. Robust PCA has been widely considered in machine learning applications, which aim to decompose data matrices effectively. Additionally, robust principal component analysis has also found its place in these applications. The low rank matrix, which is a fundamental concept, is a broader term that includes the data matrix. In practical scenarios, real applications of robust PCA are conducted in noisy image classification, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, synthetic experiments are also performed to evaluate the performance of this method in the same context. Lastly, the optimization of these processes often involves a convex problem that incorporates side information to enhance the analysis."
