    "This paper presents an unlexicalized parser for German, which is a model that employs both smoothing and suffix analysis to enhance its performance. The unlexicalized parser achieves a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2, indicating its high accuracy compared to previously reported results. The high accuracy of the model is a significant aspect, as it allows for a deeper examination of the interplay between smoothing techniques and parsing results. Furthermore, the parser utilizes smoothing and suffix analysis, which are crucial for improving parsing accuracy by addressing data sparsity and morphological variations. Overall, the unlexicalized parser for German demonstrates a superior performance in syntactic analysis, surpassing earlier metrics on the NEGRA corpus."
