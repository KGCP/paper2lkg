    "This paper presents and describes an automatic scheme for collecting statistics on cooccurrence patterns in a large corpus. This scheme is a type of methodology that collects cooccurrence patterns and was implemented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools. The results of the experiment show that cooccurrence statistics provide a basis for a useful disambiguation tool. Sentences were selected from the corpus, which has a broader term of a large corpus, to analyze these statistics. These statistics reflect semantic constraints and are used to disambiguate both anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities. Furthermore, the scheme collects statistics, which also has a broader term of statistics, thereby reinforcing the relationship between cooccurrence statistics and the semantic constraints they reflect.",
    "The manual acquisition of semantic constraints in broad domains is a process that is recognized as very expensive, highlighting the challenges associated with gathering these essential rules that govern language. This process falls under the broader category of semantic constraints. In the realm of linguistic analysis, the output of other linguistic tools is categorized under linguistic tools, which includes various methodologies used to analyze language data. Furthermore, cooccurrence statistics, which are crucial for understanding relationships in language, are a subset of statistics. A large corpus, which serves as a substantial collection of texts for analysis, is classified under the broader term corpus. An experiment, which is a systematic study, is also recognized as a type of experiment, and its results are significant as they reflect the effectiveness of cooccurrence statistics in disambiguating references. The results of the experiment are categorized under both experiment and results, emphasizing their importance in the context of research findings. Additionally, a disambiguation tool, which aids in clarifying ambiguous terms, is classified under the output of other linguistic tools and is also part of the broader category of linguistic tools."
