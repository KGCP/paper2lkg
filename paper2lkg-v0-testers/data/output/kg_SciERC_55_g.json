    "The seven categories of the scheme are classified under the broader term 'scheme', which serves as an annotation framework for scientific articles. This paper introduces an annotation scheme for scientific articles that is designed to enhance the development of training resources. The scheme is characterized by its reproducibility and intuitiveness, as demonstrated by our experimental results, which show that the scheme is stable and effective. Furthermore, the annotation scheme for scientific articles can be utilized to build a resource that aids in the annotation process. Both the scheme and the seven categories are based on rhetorical moves, which are strategic techniques used in argumentation, highlighting the connection between the annotation framework and the underlying principles of effective communication."
