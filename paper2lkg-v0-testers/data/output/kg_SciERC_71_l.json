    "The authors, We, investigate the weak equivalence of Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars. This investigation involves a discussion comparing the linguistic expressiveness of these two formalisms, which highlights their similarities in capturing nuances in meaning and syntax. The relationship between Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars is characterized by their shared ability to describe natural language structures through tree-like structures. Furthermore, both formalisms have broader terms that encompass their expressive power: for Tree Adjoining Grammars, this term is 'formalisms', while for Head Grammars it is also 'formalisms'. Similarly, the relationship between these two grammatical formalisms has a broader term of 'relationship' that encompasses its connection to other linguistic concepts."
