    "We present a scanning method that recovers dense sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence, achieving Subpixel accuracy. Our novel approach uses several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns to achieve this level of precision. In comparison, state-of-the-art methods such as mi-icro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting are also capable of recovering scene geometry with high sub-pixel precision. However, our method presents a more accurate solution for achieving dense sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence."
