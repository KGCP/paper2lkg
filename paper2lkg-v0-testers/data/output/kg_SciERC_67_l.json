    "Our novel method for discovering parallel sentences in comparable, non-parallel corpora presents our approach. This method uses a maximum entropy classifier to train and extract parallel data from large Chinese, Arabic, and English newspaper corpora. The extracted data can reliably determine whether or not they are translations of each other. We apply this method with great benefit to language pairs by exploiting the power of statistical machine translation systems that evaluate the quality of our extracted data. Moreover, we demonstrate how using a good-quality MT system built from scratch using a small parallel corpus and large non-parallel corpora can improve its performance.",
    "Recent research has led to the development of novel methods for discovering parallel sentences in comparable, non-parallel corpora. One such approach uses a maximum entropy classifier to determine whether two sentences are translations of each other or not. This method was used to extract parallel sentence pairs from large Chinese, Arabic, and English newspaper corpora. The extracted data consists of these parallel sentence pairs, which can be used as training data for machine translation systems. In fact, we show that a good-quality MT system built using this approach can accurately translate text from one language to another with high quality."
