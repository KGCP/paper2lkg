    "We introduce a novel method of shape constrained image segmentation, which combines Bayesian statistics with mixtures of feature distributions for color and texture as well as probabilistic shape knowledge. This approach has been shown to be effective in automated segmentation tasks, requiring shape information to account for robustness requirements in image understanding. Experimental evidence shows that semantically meaningful segments are inferred from the combined framework of Bayesian statistics.",
    "The automated segmentation of images is an approach that involves dividing digital images into distinct regions or objects based on their visual characteristics. This process can be facilitated by Bayesian statistics, which provides a framework for updating probability distributions based on new data or evidence. Furthermore, both methods and approaches rely on the concept of having broader terms to achieve specific goals."
