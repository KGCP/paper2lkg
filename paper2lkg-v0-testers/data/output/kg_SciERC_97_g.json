    "The method proposes a novel approach for modeling and subtraction, which is further refined in the new method that improves upon the original technique. This new method, as detailed in this paper, is specifically designed for the modeling and subtraction of scenes that exhibit persistent dynamic behavior. It encompasses broader concepts such as modeling and subtraction, which are essential for analyzing dynamic characteristics in vision systems. Background modeling, a crucial component of many vision systems, also falls under the broader term of method. The scenes analyzed through this approach are characterized by their persistent dynamic behavior, which poses significant challenges for detection performance. Inherent ambiguities that arise during feature computation are effectively addressed by employing a data-dependent bandwidth for density estimation, enhancing the overall utility and performance of the proposed approach.",
    "The modeling and subtraction of such scenes is a method that encompasses subtraction, which is a fundamental mathematical operation. This method is crucial for enhancing the utility and performance of vision systems, particularly in relation to detection performance, which is a broader term for performance. Background modeling serves as an important component of vision systems, focusing on scenes that consist of static or quasi-static structures. However, the assumption that these scenes remain unchanged is often violated by the presence of dynamic behaviors, as seen in the scene. The proposed approach, which is a specific method for addressing these challenges, utilizes optical flow computed in a higher dimensional space. To achieve accurate results, data-dependent bandwidth is employed for density estimation using kernels, which is a broader technique that encompasses density estimation. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the utility and performance of the proposed approach, showcasing its effectiveness in comparison to existing work that has addressed similar scenes."
