    "To improve topical blog post retrieval, we consider two groups of credibility indicators: one based on individual blog posts and another based on underlying blogs. The best performance is achieved when combining these indicators to estimate their values. Experiments show that both groups significantly improve retrieval effectiveness. We also integrate textual credibility indicators into a language-based approach for ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic."
