    "Analogies between words are quantified through an estimate known as the number of analogies, which is derived from experiments that analyze a multilingual corpus. A notable example of such analogies is the relationship illustrated by 'I walked : to walk : : I laughed : to laugh', which is recognized as a specific instance of analogies between words. This concept falls under the broader category of analogies, which also encompasses analogies between sentences. The number of analogies is estimated using two estimates, which include a lower one and a higher one, reflecting the varying counts of analogous relationships among sentences. The multilingual corpus contains the sentences that are analyzed for these analogies, and it is essential that these analogies maintain validity on both the levels of meaning and form. However, computational linguists express skepticism regarding the usefulness of analogies between sentences compared to those between words. Ultimately, the validity of these analogies is tested through the preservation of similar meanings.",
    "Translation is a crucial process that is tested for similar meanings, ensuring that the semantic content is preserved. It is also used to test for these similar meanings, highlighting its importance in maintaining the integrity of language. The phrases 'I walked' and 'I laughed' serve as examples of sentences, which have a broader term encompassing various linguistic units. Additionally, the sentences themselves are part of this broader category. In the context of translation, it is essential that meaning is preserved to establish valid analogies. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on a multilingual corpus to explore these relationships and test hypotheses related to language processing."
