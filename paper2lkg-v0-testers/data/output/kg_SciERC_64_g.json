    "This paper evaluates a trainable sentence planner, which is an advanced component designed to generate coherent sentences in dialogue systems. The trainable sentence planner has a broader term that includes rule-based sentence planners, two rule-based sentence planners, and two baseline sentence planners. Notably, the trainable sentence planner performs better than the hand-crafted system and the rule-based systems, showcasing its effectiveness in generating high-quality utterances. Furthermore, the quality of utterances produced with trainable components can compete with those generated by hand-crafted template-based or rule-based approaches. Techniques for automatically training modules of a natural language generator have been proposed to enhance the performance of these trainable components. Overall, the evaluation highlights the superiority of the trainable sentence planner over traditional methods, including baseline sentence planners and rule-based approaches.",
    "The quality of utterances produced with trainable components can compete with rule-based approaches, indicating a significant advancement in natural language generation. A trainable sentence planner is specifically designed for spoken dialogue systems, and it has been shown to perform better than traditional rule-based systems. In an exhaustive comparison, two rule-based sentence planners and a hand-crafted template-based generation component are evaluated alongside two baseline sentence planners, highlighting the effectiveness of the trainable sentence planner. This comparison also elicits subjective human judgments, which are crucial for assessing the quality of generated utterances. Techniques for automatically training modules of a natural language generator have been proposed to enhance the capabilities of these systems, further bridging the gap between automated and rule-based methods. Overall, the landscape of natural language generation is evolving, with trainable components demonstrating their potential to surpass established rule-based systems.",
    "The trainable sentence planner performs better than the baselines, showcasing its advanced capabilities in generating coherent and contextually appropriate sentences. The quality of utterances produced with trainable components is a subset of utterances, emphasizing the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in dialogue systems. Additionally, rule-based approaches are a broader category that encompasses rule-based systems, which in turn includes the rule-based systems that rely on predefined rules for natural language generation. In the context of evaluation, two baseline sentence planners serve as a broader term for the baselines, which also includes baseline sentence planners and the baselines themselves, all of which are used as reference points in assessing the performance of the trainable sentence planner."
