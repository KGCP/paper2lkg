    "We present Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding for statistical machine translation, which reports on the performance of MBR decoders. Our results show that this approach can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions. We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that measure translation performance and incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings. This methodology is based on Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding, a statistical method that minimizes the expected risk of error."
