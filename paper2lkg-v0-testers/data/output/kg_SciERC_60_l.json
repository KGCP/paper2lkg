    "The Chat-80, a prototype natural language question answering system implemented entirely in Prolog, uses extraposition grammars to translate English questions into the Prolog subset of logic. This process involves converting these questions into logical expressions that can be executed by a planning algorithm to yield an answer. The resulting logical expression is transformed by this algorithm and then optimized for efficient execution in the Prolog form, which ultimately yields the final answer."
