    "Our method is a specific implementation of a scanning method that recovers sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence while achieving high subpixel precision. It effectively handles the challenges posed by active reconstruction systems and demonstrates superior performance compared to state of the art methods, including mi-cro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting. The method utilizes gray-level band-pass white noise patterns, which enhance robustness to indirect lighting, and it achieves subpixel accuracy by analyzing zero-crossings defined by the difference between unstructured patterns. Simulated and experimental results show that our method successfully recovers scene geometry, establishing its effectiveness in the field.",
    "State of the art methods include modulated phase shifting, which is a technique utilized in active reconstruction systems. This inclusion highlights the advanced and effective methodologies that are currently available, showcasing how modulated phase shifting enhances the precision of scene geometry recovery."
