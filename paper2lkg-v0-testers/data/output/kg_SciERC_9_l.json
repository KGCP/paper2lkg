    "This spectral clustering based approach uses an unsupervised learning method that calculates eigenvectors of an adjacency graph's Laplacian. This paper presents this approach, which outperforms other clustering methods and has been shown to be effective in disambiguating various relations between named entities through experiment. The process involves calculating eigenvectors and then performing cluster number estimation on them. It works by calculating the eigenvalues of an adjacency graph's Laplacian, allowing for unsupervised learning approach that can disambiguate various relations between named entities."
