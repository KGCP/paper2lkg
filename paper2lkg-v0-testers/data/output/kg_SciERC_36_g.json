    "The result applies to the problem of distributional approximation, which involves approximating probabilistic context-free grammars using probabilistic finite automata. The applications of the result have a broader term that encompasses various applications of the analytical solution for the Kullback-Leibler distance. The Kullback-Leibler distance, also known as relative entropy, has an analytical solution that is expressed in a closed-form. This distance quantifies the difference between a probabilistic context-free grammar and a probabilistic finite automaton, and it is related to the concept of cross-entropy. Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler distance has a solution for the cross-entropy component, which is crucial in the context of evaluating the performance of probabilistic models. Ultimately, probabilistic context-free grammars are approximated by probabilistic finite automata, highlighting the practical implications of these theoretical concepts."
