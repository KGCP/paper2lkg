    "The mixed-signal paradigm is presented for high-resolution parallel inner-product computation, which utilizes this paradigm to achieve efficient processing. At the core of this approach is a low-power analog array that performs binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication. This architecture is supported by an externally digital architecture that enhances its capabilities. The process involves random statistics, which are derived from the analog summation of binary products, ensuring that the computations maintain full digital resolution despite the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion. The CID/DRAM analog array prototype, fabricated using a cost-effective 0.5 cents m CMOS process, exemplifies this technology. The approach has been validated with real image data and experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in image processing applications. Additionally, a random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics from highly correlated inputs, further optimizing the performance of the system. Overall, the integration of these components and techniques allows for high-resolution computations while maintaining digital resolution.",
    "Real image data is a specific type of image data, as it has a broader term that encompasses various forms of digital representations of visual information. While image data can refer to any digital representation of visual information, real image data specifically pertains to actual visual data obtained from real-world images, which is crucial for validating the proposed mixed-signal paradigm for high-resolution image processing."
