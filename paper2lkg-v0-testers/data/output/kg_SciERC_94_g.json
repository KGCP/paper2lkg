    "This poster paper presents a comprehensive two-level morphological analysis of Turkish word structures and morphological constructions. It describes a full scale two-level morphological description that is based on a root word lexicon containing approximately 23,000 root words. Turkish word structures, which are surface realizations of morphological constructions, are characteristic of the agglutinative nature of the Turkish language. The PC-KIMMO environment, which has been implemented using PC-KIMMO, utilizes this root word lexicon to analyze and generate morphological descriptions. Furthermore, the surface realizations of morphological constructions are constrained and modified by phonetic rules, while derivational and inflectional suffixes play a crucial role in the formation of words, allowing root words to convert into various grammatical structures, including verbal and nominal forms.",
    "In the study of Turkish morphology, derivational and inflectional suffixes are recognized as a subset of morphemes, which are fundamental units that can be added to a stem to form new words. These morphemes play a crucial role in converting root words into various grammatical forms, thereby facilitating the creation of adverbial constructs. However, there are special cases that serve as exceptions to the established morphological rules, which are systematically described in the morphological description of the language. These exceptions are also categorized under a broader term known as exceptions. Additionally, inflectional suffixes, which are a type of morpheme, further illustrate the complexity of morphological rules. The finite-state model is another broader concept that encompasses these morphological descriptions, particularly in the context of Turkish. Phonetic rules, including phenomena such as vowel harmony, govern the pronunciation of words and are integral to understanding the phonological aspects of the language."
