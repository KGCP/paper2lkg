    "This model enables complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics and mimics the way in which images are processed in the visual pathway. The bio-inspired model permits the realization of these dynamics and is based on studies on the vertebrate retina, which informs its design. A prototype chip, which is a broader term for chip, is designed and fabricated using a 0.5 \u00b5m standard CMOS process, achieving computing power per area that is amongst the highest reported for a single chip. Additionally, design challenges are presented in this paper, highlighting the obstacles faced in developing this bio-inspired technology. Power consumption is also a critical aspect, as it is part of the overall computing power per area metric.",
    "In this paper, both trade-offs and experimental results are presented, highlighting the complexities involved in decision-making processes and the empirical data obtained from experiments. The discussion of trade-offs emphasizes the balancing of competing factors, while the experimental results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the methodologies explored."
