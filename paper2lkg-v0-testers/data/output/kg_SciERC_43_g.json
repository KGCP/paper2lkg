    "This paper presents a machine learning approach that applies to bare slice disambiguation, which involves dialogue. The approach utilizes rules that can be learnt automatically from these features, which have a broader term known as features. Two different machine learning algorithms, specifically SLIPPER and TiMBL, are employed in this context. Both learners perform well, yielding success rates of approximately 90%. The rules resemble Horn clauses, and the heuristic principles are formulated as probabilistic Horn clauses. The machine learning approach is a broader term that encompasses machine learning algorithms and machine learning itself. Additionally, probabilistic Horn clauses have a broader term referred to as clauses, while the predicates of such clauses also have a broader term known as features.",
    "In the realm of machine learning, two different machine learning algorithms, namely SLIPPER and TiMBL, are utilized for various tasks. Both of these algorithms fall under the broader category of machine learning algorithms, which encompasses computational methods that enable computers to learn from data. SLIPPER, a rule-based learning algorithm, and TiMBL, a memory-based system, are specifically employed to analyze and annotate an input dataset for bare slice disambiguation in dialogue. Heuristic principles, derived from a corpus-based sample, play a crucial role in this process by extracting guidelines that can be formulated as probabilistic Horn clauses. These clauses, which extend traditional Horn clauses, help create domain independent features that are essential for the annotation task. The features themselves possess predictive power, allowing the algorithms to make informed decisions based on the input data. Overall, both learners, SLIPPER and TiMBL, contribute significantly to the field of machine learning by leveraging these principles and features."
