  "summary": "In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse . In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them . The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds . The attentional state , being dynamic , records the objects , properties , and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions . The theory of attention , intention , and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses . Various properties of discourse are described , and explanations for the behaviour of cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions are explored . This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse . Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments , recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions , and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state . This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants ' knowledge of the domain .",

    "According to a new theory of discourse structure, attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances play crucial roles. This framework emphasizes the importance of these components, which are composed of linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. The role of information from the discourse requires recognizing purposes expressed in each segment as well as relationships among them. A new theory of discourse structure captures intentional structure, highlighting the significance of purpose and processing in shaping discourse. This paper explores a new theory of discourse structure emphasizing the roles of purpose and processing, which is illustrated through example discourses.",
    "According to the theory of discourse structure, discourse can be understood as composed of three interrelated components: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. The intentional structure captures the purposes expressed in each linguistic segment and relationships among them. This framework emphasizes the roles of purpose and processing in shaping discourse. Furthermore, the aggregation of utterances is part of a larger theory that requires recognizing the role of information from the discourse. Various properties of discourse describe its organization, pattern, or arrangement, which can be influenced by cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.",
    "According to this new theory of discourse structure, the organization and relationships within language can be understood as composed of three interrelated components: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. The linguistic structure refers to the sequence of utterances that naturally aggregate into segments of the discourse. Intentional structures capture the purposes and relationships between them relevant to a discourse's progression. Meanwhile, the attentional state represents the dynamic focus of attention as it unfolds during conversation or text. This framework emphasizes the roles of purpose and processing in shaping discourse.",
    "The sequence of utterances, comprising linguistic segments that naturally aggregate into discourse-structured units, is influenced by attentional states and intentions. The role of purpose and processing in discourse highlights how individuals process and respond to linguistic stimuli through attending to certain aspects, forming intentions based on those stimuli, and aggregating their verbal outputs. This intentional structure captures the purposes or goals expressed in each segment and relationships among them. Furthermore, participants' knowledge of the domain provides a framework for describing the role of information from the discourse, which is processed through attentional states mechanisms.",
    "The state of focus of attention, which can be broadened to include attention itself, evolves over time as the discourse unfolds. This dynamic process involves linguistic structures and their components, which are shaped by theories such as attentional states. The participants' intentions have relationships among them, influencing how they recognize tasks that involve information from the discourse. As this focus of attention changes, it is characterized by properties that reflect its being dynamic."
