    "The classifiers, which include both the Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes models, significantly affect classifiers' performances in predicting the addressee of dialogue acts. These classifiers have a broader term that encompasses all classifiers used in this context. While the classifiers show some gain from information about meeting context, they demonstrate little additional benefit from it. In terms of performance, both classifiers perform best when combined with speaker's gaze information, utterance features, and conversational context. Addressee identification, which is based on gaze and conversational context features, presents results specifically in the context of four-participant face-to-face meetings. The addressee of a dialogue act can be predicted based on both gaze and conversational context features, highlighting the importance of these elements in effective communication.",
    "In the realm of dialogue, the addressee of a dialogue act is a specific instance of the broader term addressee, which refers to the individual receiving a communicative action. The process of addressee identification is fundamentally based on the utterance, as it helps determine who the intended recipient is. Furthermore, the addressee of a dialogue act can also be predicted based on the utterance, highlighting the importance of spoken expressions in communication. Additionally, the addressee is similarly predictable through the utterance, reinforcing the connection between these elements. In a broader context, the utterance itself is categorized under the term dialogue act, which encompasses various communicative functions. In the field of machine learning, Naive Bayes classifiers utilize Naive Bayes algorithms and Bayesian Networks to enhance classification tasks, showcasing the application of probabilistic models in understanding and predicting dialogue dynamics."
