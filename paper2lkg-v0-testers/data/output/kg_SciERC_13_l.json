  "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun . In Thai language , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun . Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .",

    "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun, which can be used to overcome problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrases. The choice of classifier for a given concrete noun is governed by the corpus-based method proposed here, which generates associations between nouns and their corresponding classifiers. However, there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun due to the lack of fixed rules governing this process. To address this issue, we propose a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun based on its meaning representation constraints. This approach can be used as an alternative to the traditional rule-based method, which also relies on predefined rules and guidelines for selecting classifiers.",
    "An algorithm, also referred to as an algorithm, is a step-by-step procedure used to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular goal. This method has its broader term defined by another algorithm. A classifier, which can be classified under an algorithm, is a category or feature used to classify nouns in language, often based on grammatical properties such as animacy or definiteness. NCA, created from and having its broader term defined by a large corpus, represents a conceptual grouping or category derived from this collection of texts. Concrete nouns, which have their broader term defined by noun, are words that refer to tangible objects with specific shapes, sizes, colors, textures, etc."
