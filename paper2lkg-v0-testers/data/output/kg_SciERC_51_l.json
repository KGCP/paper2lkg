    "This paper describes three incremental probabilistic parser models that incorporate syntactic priming to simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures found in human data and improve overall parsing accuracy. These models involve priming of rules between sentences, within sentences, and within coordinate structures, which is a phenomenon observed in psycholinguistic literature as syntactically repeating structures often used in natural language processing models. The three models are compared, showing that they simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures found in human data and yield a small increase in overall parsing accuracy."
