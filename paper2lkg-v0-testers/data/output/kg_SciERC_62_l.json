    "The process of evaluating machine translation systems using standard metrics such as BLEU, NIST, WER, and PER can produce useful features for paraphrase classification. Our results show that MT evaluation techniques are able to produce these features, which in turn enable building classifiers to predict semantic equivalence and entailment. In fact, our novel technique based on PER leverages part-of-speech information of the words contributing to word matches and non-matches in a sentence, giving a substantial improvement in paraphrase classification accuracy. This approach is closely related to the task of machine translation, which itself is an important application area for standard MT evaluation methods."
