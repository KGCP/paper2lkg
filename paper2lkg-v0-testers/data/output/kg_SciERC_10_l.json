    "This formalism strongly simulates a generic mathematical formalism, which proposes a framework for combining various structures such as strings, trees, directed acyclic graphs, and graph products. This paper proposes this generic mathematical formalism, which combines these structures to simulate many grammar formalisms. Grammar formalisms are simulated by TAG, rewriting systems, LFG, dependency grammars, and HPSG, all of which have a broader term in 'formalism'.",
    "Rewriting systems, LFG, dependency grammars, and HPSG are all formalisms that have a broader term of formalism. This highlights their shared roots in linguistic theory."
