    "In this context, UNL graphs are used as the best candidates for sharing text revisions across languages. A LO-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary establishes liaisons between elements of the text and the graph, allowing for conversions to be made using UNL-L0 representations. We are developing a prototype that uses these dictionaries to facilitate cooperative working on multilingual documents. The associated graph is used as a visual representation of interconnected data or concepts, with deconverters in other languages sent to it. Furthermore, UNL graphs have broader terms such as 'graph' and 'associated graph', while UNL-L0 has a broader term called 'deconverter'. Additionally, the UNL-tree corresponds to an MS- L0 structure.",
    "The development of a prototype for sharing multilingual documents across languages allows naive users to interact directly with text in their language and indirectly with an associated graph. This enables cooperative working on a document, which renders feasible the process of adding new versions while preserving integrity. The modified graph represents interconnected data or concepts, facilitating improvement sharing that is both visible and encouraging.",
    "The multilingual document, which contains text in multiple languages, has a broader concept of 'document'. Naive users interact directly with the text in their native language. The central goal aims to merge approaches from pivot MT and interactive MT, as well as multilingual text authoring. This research project also involves displaying versions in other languages known by the user, which is considered a result. Furthermore, this study modifies its graph representation, showing it as a result. Additionally, an associated graph has a broader concept of 'result', while the final output, 'result shown', also falls under this category."
