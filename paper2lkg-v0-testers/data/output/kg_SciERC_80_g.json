    "Synchronous TAGs are a variant of TAGs that characterize correspondences between languages, highlighting their role in semantic interpretation and automatic translation. This formalism not only relates to natural languages but also extends to logical form languages, thereby addressing computational issues that arise in their interpretation. Synchronous TAGs mention these computational challenges and are applied to concrete examples, demonstrating their practical utility. Furthermore, this formalism has broader terms, including TAG and a variant of TAGs, which also characterize the relationships between languages. The formalism is used beyond syntax proper, emphasizing its relevance in semantics and the translation of expressions into another natural language.",
    "Synchronous TAGs discuss the application of concrete examples, illustrating their utility in various contexts. The logical form language and natural language both have a broader term, which is languages, encompassing the diverse systems of communication used by humans. Furthermore, semantic interpretation, which is essential for understanding meaning in natural language, also has a broader term known as interpretation. Automatic translation is specifically related to natural language, as it involves translating text or speech from one language to another. Additionally, semantic interpretation is a subset of semantics, highlighting the relationship between the analysis of meaning and the broader field of linguistic study."
