    "question": "What is the role of the 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT?",
    "answer": "MEL enables the extraction of metadata and content-based information from various file formats such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip.",
    "LLM_answer": "The 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT plays a crucial role by extracting all textual content and orchestrating the first two blocks of NER models. It implements several data extraction operations, which are essential for processing and managing the textual data that TNNT uses for named entity recognition tasks.",

    "question": "What are the four motivations behind the development of TNNT?",
    "answer": "The motivations are: (1) to easily pre-process documents for NER analysis, (2) to easily use documents with different formats for NER analysis, (3) to hide usage variations across NER models and NLP tools and bring them under one uniform pipeline, and (4) to provide a framework for analysing results from different NER models and NLP tools.",
    "LLM_answer": "The four motivations behind the development of TNNT are: (1) to be able to easily pre-process documents for NER analysis, (2) the ability to process different source document formats for NER, (3) having several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for easy execution, comparison, and identification of the most suitable block of NER models for a specific task or input domain, and (4) enabling a large number of NER tools and models for use which have enabled NER of different categories from text.",

    "question": "What kind of information does TNNT retrieve for each recognised entity?",
    "answer": "For each recognised entity, TNNT retrieves context information, start/end indices in the document text, and statistics of the entities identified by each model for respective categories along with start/end timestamps and the duration taken by the models to run the NER task.",
    "LLM_answer": "TNNT retrieves a set of information specific to each recognized entity. This includes contextual details for the entities, such as their start and end indices in a given document. This information is part of the toolkit's capability to extract categorized named entities from unstructured information.",
