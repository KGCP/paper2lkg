    "question": "What is the role of the 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT?",
    "answer": "MEL enables the extraction of metadata and content-based information from various file formats such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip.",
    "LLM_answer": "The 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT plays a crucial role in extracting all textual content from source documents. It orchestrates the first two blocks of the processing sequence and implements data extraction operations. MEL is integrated with TNNT, allowing it to process and manage the textual content that is then used in the hybrid processing data flow of TNNT, which applies various Named Entity Recognition (NER) models.",
