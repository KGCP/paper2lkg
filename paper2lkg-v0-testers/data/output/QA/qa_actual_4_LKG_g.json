    "question": "What is the role of the 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT?",
    "answer": "MEL enables the extraction of metadata and content-based information from various file formats such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip.",
    "LLM_answer": "The role of the 'Metadata Extractor & Loader' (MEL) in TNNT is to facilitate the extraction of metadata and content-based information from a variety of file formats, such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .msg, .csv, .txt, and .zip. MEL is responsible for extracting textual content from these sources, enabling it to be processed for named entity recognition tasks within the TNNT toolkit. It implements data extraction operations and provides the extracted text data that is processable for TNNT, thus playing a crucial role in preparing the data for further analysis and integration with Named Entity Recognition models.",

    "question": "What are the four motivations behind the development of TNNT?",
    "answer": "The motivations are: (1) to easily pre-process documents for NER analysis, (2) to easily use documents with different formats for NER analysis, (3) to hide usage variations across NER models and NLP tools and bring them under one uniform pipeline, and (4) to provide a framework for analysing results from different NER models and NLP tools.",
    "LLM_answer": "The four motivations behind the development of TNNT are: 1) to automate the extraction of categorized named entities from unstructured information, 2) to integrate multiple state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) models and tools into a single processing pipeline, 3) to fill the void of a unified toolkit for NER, and 4) to provide a modular and extensible framework for NER analysis.",

    "question": "What kind of information does TNNT retrieve for each recognised entity?",
    "answer": "For each recognised entity, TNNT retrieves context information, start/end indices in the document text, and statistics of the entities identified by each model for respective categories along with start/end timestamps and the duration taken by the models to run the NER task.",
    "LLM_answer": "For each recognised entity, TNNT retrieves context information, start/end indices, and document text. This means that TNNT not only identifies the entities but also provides details about their surrounding context within the text, their exact positions, and the text from which they were extracted.",
