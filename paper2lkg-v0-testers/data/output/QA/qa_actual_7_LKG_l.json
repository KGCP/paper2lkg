The number of class links is not explicitly mentioned in the provided resources, but the focus on increasing class links suggests that it is a significant aspect of Wikidata's structure. The number of class links is likely smaller than the total number of classes, as the goal is to increase these links to facilitate better integration and linking of classes from other namespaces.",
