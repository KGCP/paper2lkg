    "question": "What is the primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications as described in the paper?",
    "answer": "The primary goal is to predict high IC-score research proposals based on the IC scores assigned by expert reviewers and to develop a predictive vocabulary for contemporaneous proposals.",
    "LLM_answer": "The primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications, as described in the paper, is to predict high IC-score research proposals and understand the vocabulary of innovative grant applications. This involves using a Random Forest classifier with features denoting the presence or absence of unigrams, encoded with a modified Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, to assist in the manual review of research proposals and help human evaluators better screen excellent research proposals.",

  {
    "question": "What is the modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper and how does it differ from the traditional TF-IDF?",
    "answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF, assigning the IDF value to a term if it exists in the documents and a value of 0 if it does not. This differs from the traditional TF-IDF, which uses both term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).",
    "LLM_answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper is a statistical method used to weight the importance of terms in a document or corpus based on their frequency and rarity across all documents. This modified version differs from the traditional TF-IDF by incorporating an intra-class dispersion algorithm, which adjusts term weights to increase the importance of rare but significant words and decrease the weightage of frequent but less important words. This modification aims to improve the effectiveness of the term weighting in information retrieval tasks.",

However, it is mentioned that the median IC score is based on the selection range, which includes research proposals with moderate IC scores (15%~85%). To find the exact median IC score, one would need to refer to the specific data or tables in the academic paper, such as Table 1, which shows statistics of IC scores.",
