    "question": "What is the modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper and how does it differ from the traditional TF-IDF?",
    "answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF, assigning the IDF value to a term if it exists in the documents and a value of 0 if it does not. This differs from the traditional TF-IDF, which uses both term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).",
    "LLM_answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper is a variation of the traditional TF-IDF algorithm, which is used for natural language processing and information retrieval tasks such as text analysis and feature extraction. The modified version still uses TF-IDF as the feature extraction technique, but it is implemented using the gensim library, which is a popular open-source Python library for natural language processing. The paper does not provide specific details on how the modified TF-IDF algorithm differs from the traditional TF-IDF in terms of its mathematical formulation or implementation, but it suggests that the modification is aimed at improving the identification of the most influential terms for text classification tasks, possibly in conjunction with DT (Decision Tree) and RF (Random Forest) classifiers.",
