In comparison, Wikidata has 74,309 declared properties, which are explicitly defined. The number of declared classes is not directly provided, but the number of declared properties gives an indication of the scale of explicitly defined elements in Wikidata. The unique undeclared classes significantly outnumber the declared properties, highlighting a large portion of the class structure in Wikidata that remains undeclared according to formal ontological standards.",
