    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the MEL tool as described in the abstract?",
    "answer": "The primary purpose of the MEL tool is to extract metadata and content-based information from unstructured information encoded in different source document formats, aiding pre-processing tasks as part of a Knowledge Graph Construction Pipeline (KGCP).",
    "LLM_answer": "The primary purpose of the MEL tool, as described in the abstract, is to extract metadata and content-based information from unstructured data sets of heterogeneous file formats. It is a general-purpose mechanism that supports more than 20 different file types and performs pre-processing, data cleaning, and basic text analysis tasks. MEL generates the results in a machine-readable format (JSON), making it useful for various applications.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the JSON result files generated by MEL?",
    "answer": "The JSON result files generated by MEL can easily be mapped to RDF using tools such as J2RM, facilitating their use in automated KGCPs.",
    "LLM_answer": "The JSON result files generated by MEL are significant because they provide a machine-readable format for the extracted metadata and text content from various file types. This allows for easy exchange and integration of structured data between different systems and applications. By using JSON, MEL ensures that the results are standardized and can be readily used for further processing, analysis, or storage in other systems.",
