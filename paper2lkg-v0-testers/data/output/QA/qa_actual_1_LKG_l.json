    "question": "What is the significance of the JSON result files generated by MEL?",
    "answer": "The JSON result files generated by MEL can easily be mapped to RDF using tools such as J2RM, facilitating their use in automated KGCPs.",
    "LLM_answer": "The JSON result files generated by MEL are significant because they provide a machine-readable format for the extracted metadata and text content from various file types. This allows for easy integration and further processing of the data by other systems or applications. The use of JSON as a standardized data interchange format ensures that the results are structured and can be easily consumed by different tools and platforms, facilitating interoperability and data exchange.",
