    "LLM_answer": "The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) plays a significant role in the development of BCI-O's Sense Model by providing a standard framework ontology that facilitates the integration and interoperability of sensor data. BCI-O's Sense Model leverages the SSN to enhance semantic interoperability and integration within Brain-Computer Interaction systems. The Sense Model is aligned with the SOSA/SSN upper ontologies and is based on the Stimulus-Sensor-Observation Ontology Design Pattern, which is part of the SSN framework. This alignment allows BCI-O to effectively describe the interaction between contextual stimuli and sensory observations, thereby improving the semantic understanding and processing of BCI data.",
