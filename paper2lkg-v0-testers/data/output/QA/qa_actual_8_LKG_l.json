    "question": "What is the role of the Context Model in BCI-O?",
    "answer": "The Context Model in BCI-O captures the architectural description of a physical or virtual environment, based on a sequence of scenes, each depicting a collection of spatially located entities interacting with one another in a specific way.",
    "LLM_answer": "The role of the Context Model in BCI-O is to provide a conceptual framework that formalizes metadata for capturing data in various contexts, including physical and virtual environments. It is a novel model that associates context architectonic definitions with data recordings, making Brain-Computer Interaction systems semantically context-aware for real and virtual-world situations. The Context Model is built based on relevant abstractions curated from the gaming architectural modeling of the Unity framework and is properly aligned to the DUL ontology. It is an integral part of BCI-O, which formalizes relevant metadata for Brain-Computer Interaction data capture activities by integrating Sense and Actuation Models along with this novel Context Model.",

    "LLM_answer": "The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) plays a significant role in the development of BCI-O's Sense Model by providing a standardized framework for describing sensor networks, which is crucial for semantic interoperability. BCI-O extends and leverages the SSN to integrate sensors, observations, and actuators, facilitating data exchange and processing. The Sense Model in BCI-O is aligned with the SOSA/SSN upper ontologies and employs the Stimulus-Sensor-Observation Ontology Design Pattern, which is initially specialized from the SSN Skeleton module. This alignment and extension of SSN enable BCI-O to effectively model the contextual input data and events to the subject, enhancing the semantic interoperability and integration of BCI systems.",
