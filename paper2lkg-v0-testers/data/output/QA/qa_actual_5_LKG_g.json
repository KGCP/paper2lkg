    "question": "What is the primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications as described in the paper?",
    "answer": "The primary goal is to predict high IC-score research proposals based on the IC scores assigned by expert reviewers and to develop a predictive vocabulary for contemporaneous proposals.",
    "LLM_answer": "The primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications is to predict high/low IC-score research proposals. This involves using data mining techniques to identify and analyze the essential features of the research proposals, assisting human evaluators in the manual review process, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals. The data mining model aims to enhance the screening process for evaluators, improve the quality of funding project evaluations, and develop guidelines for future assessments.",

    "question": "What is the modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper and how does it differ from the traditional TF-IDF?",
    "answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF, assigning the IDF value to a term if it exists in the documents and a value of 0 if it does not. This differs from the traditional TF-IDF, which uses both term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).",
    "LLM_answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper is an adaptation of the traditional TF-IDF method, focusing on enhancing the inverse document frequency (IDF) component for improved feature extraction and text representation. This modified algorithm is implemented using the gensim library and is evaluated based on classification accuracy and F1 score. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, which calculates the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents, the modified TF-IDF can be understood as a simple encoding technique that assigns a value of 0 or the IDF value of a term based on its presence in research proposals. This approach facilitates the transformation of textual data into a quantitative format for analysis. The modified TF-IDF algorithm is used in the final proposed model, which is a Random Forest classifier, and it does not affect the shape of the decision tree used in the model.",
