    "question": "What is the primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications as described in the paper?",
    "answer": "The primary goal is to predict high IC-score research proposals based on the IC scores assigned by expert reviewers and to develop a predictive vocabulary for contemporaneous proposals.",
    "LLM_answer": "The primary goal of applying a data mining model to the 2019 grant applications is to predict high/low IC-score research proposals. This involves using data mining techniques to identify and analyze the essential features of the research proposals, assisting human evaluators in the manual review process, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals. The application of data mining models aims to enhance the screening process, improve the quality of funding project evaluations, and ensure that innovative and high-quality research proposals are effectively identified.",

    "question": "What is the modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper and how does it differ from the traditional TF-IDF?",
    "answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF, assigning the IDF value to a term if it exists in the documents and a value of 0 if it does not. This differs from the traditional TF-IDF, which uses both term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).",
    "LLM_answer": "The modified TF-IDF algorithm proposed in the paper is an adaptation of the traditional TF-IDF method, focusing on enhancing the inverse document frequency (IDF) component for improved feature extraction and text representation. This modified algorithm is implemented using the IDF part of TF-IDF and can be understood as a simple encoding technique that assigns a value of 0 or the IDF value of a term based on its presence in research proposals. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, which calculates the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents by considering both its frequency in the document and its rarity across the document set, the modified version simplifies this by focusing on the IDF component. The modified TF-IDF algorithm is used as a feature extraction technique and is evaluated based on classification accuracy and F1 score. It is implemented using the Python library Gensim and is used in conjunction with a Random Forest (RF) classifier as part of the final proposed model. The modified TF-IDF algorithm does not affect the shape of the decision tree used in the RF classifier.",

    "LLM_answer": "The median IC score of the research proposals in the dataset is not explicitly provided in the given resources. However, the median IC score is a statistical measure representing the middle value of the innovation and creativity scores assigned to research proposals, indicating that half of the proposals scored below this value and half scored above it. To find the exact median IC score, one would need access to the actual dataset of IC scores.",
