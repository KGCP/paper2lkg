  "summary": "Data mining techniques can transform massive amounts of unstructured data into quantitative data that quickly reveal insights, trends, and patterns behind the original data. In this paper, a data mining model is applied to analyse the 2019 grant applications submitted to an Australian Government research funding agency to investigate whether grant schemes successfully identifies innovative project proposals, as intended. The grant applications are peer-reviewed research proposals that include specific 'innovation and creativity' (IC) scores assigned by reviewers. In addition to predicting the IC score for each research proposal, we are particularly interested in understanding the vocabulary of innovative proposals. In order to solve this problem, various data mining models and feature encoding algorithms are studied and explored. As a result, we propose a model with the best performance, a Random Forest (RF) classifier over documents encoded with features denoting the presence or absence of unigrams. In specific, the unigram terms are encoded by a modified Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, which only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF. Besides the proposed model, this paper also presents a rigorous experimental pipeline for analysing grant applications, and the experimental results prove its feasibility.\n\nIn the 21st century, developing advanced scientific research is crucial for countries, leading government funding agencies to provide substantial financial support. Evaluating research proposals for funding is a rigorous process, often involving expert panels. With the rising number of proposals, agencies are increasingly using data mining models to assist in reviews, although these models cannot fully replace manual checks. Data mining offers benefits such as highlighting key features of proposals, aiding evaluators in assessing strengths and weaknesses, and establishing guidelines for future evaluations. This paper aims to apply a data mining model with effective feature extraction to predict high IC-score proposals and develop a predictive vocabulary. The study employs Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for comparison. Key contributions include a strict experimental pipeline, a model using a Random Forest classifier with unigram term features encoded by a modified TF-IDF algorithm, achieving 84.17% accuracy. The paper is structured into six sections covering motivation, background, methodology, project design, experimental results, and conclusions.\n\nOztaysi et al. proposed a multi-criteria evaluation method for research proposals using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and a fuzzy preference relation matrix. The Preference Selection Index (PSI) method allows evaluation without needing to determine weight criteria. A related system utilized TF-IDF and LDA for paper classification, showing that LDA with 30 keywords yielded the best F-score. TF-IDF is widely used in data mining, adjusting term weights to emphasize rare words. Guo and Yang identified TF-IDF's shortcomings, leading to new algorithms like TF-IGM, which outperformed traditional TF-IDF. Various studies improved TF-IDF for sentiment classification and classification discrimination. In data mining, decision tree (DT) classifiers and random forest (RF) classifiers are popular for their decision-making transparency. A news classification method combined TF-IDF with Support Vector Machine (SVM), and experiments showed RF with Bagging performed best. Wongso et al. compared TF-IDF and SVD for feature selection, achieving optimal results with Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n\nThis section outlines the workflow of our proposed pipeline for analyzing grant applications, specifically using the 2019 Australian Government research funding agency data set, which includes 3,805 proposals with peer-reviewed IC scores (1-7). Various grant types are represented, and additional assessment scores are provided. Text extraction from PDF proposals is performed using a Metadata Extractor & Loader (MEL), with data stored in a CouchDB database. A statistical analysis of IC scores is conducted, revealing that 3,693 proposals have valid scores, with a median score of 5.0. Text pre-processing techniques, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop word deletion, and stemming, are applied to enhance model performance. A modified TF-IDF algorithm is proposed for feature extraction, focusing on rare terms to define innovativeness. Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers are employed to classify proposals based on their IC scores, with experiments conducted on low (0-15%) and high (85-100%) IC-score proposals. Additionally, moderate IC-score proposals (15-85%) are analyzed to explore their relationship with high and low scores, using various cut-off options for testing.\n\nThis section outlines the experimental settings for the paper. MEL is implemented using Python methods to extract metadata from various file types, utilizing Tesseract-OCR and pdftotext for PDFs. Statistical analysis of grant applications employs Python and Numpy for calculating IC score metrics. Data mining models, including DT and RF classifiers, are implemented using the scikit-learn library, while gensim is used for the TF-IDF algorithm. Hyper-parameter tuning is performed using Bayesian Optimization, defining models and their parameters, with n_iter for optimization steps and init_points for random exploration. The RF classifier's parameters include max_depth, min_samples_split, max_features, max_samples_leaf, and n_estimators, while DT classifier parameters are similarly defined. Both classifiers use 10-fold cross-validation. Performance evaluation of the modified TF-IDF and TF-IDF algorithms is based on classification accuracy and F1 score, with experiments conducted on a MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB memory.\n\nThe performance of the TF-IDF algorithm with Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers is compared, showing that the RF classifier consistently outperforms the DT classifier across various n-gram settings. The modified TF-IDF algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 84.17% with the RF classifier, using specific hyper-parameters. The model focuses on unigrams and identifies only 618 significant features from a vast pool. Despite some exceptions, the modified TF-IDF algorithm proves effective, highlighting the importance of rare terms. The confusion matrix reveals misclassifications, with the model performing better on low IC-score proposals. Additionally, the model shows a correlation between moderate IC scores and high/low IC scores, indicating that high IC proposals use more diverse language. A separate model for Ideas Grant applications achieves 82.5% accuracy, but the analysis of the 'Innovation and Creativity statement' section yields only 68.33% accuracy, challenging initial assumptions about its relevance.\n\nIn summary, a pipeline for analysing grant applications has been proposed with several crucial steps. The proposed data mining model is an RF classifier over documents encoded with features denoting the presence or absence of unigrams. Specifically, the unigram terms are encoded by a modified Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) algorithm, which only implements the IDF part of TF-IDF. As a result, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 84.17% based on all types of grant applications. In addition, we also build experiments for Ideas Grants only and \u201cInnovation and Creativity statement\u201d single section.\n\nThe future work can be carried out from different perspectives. Firstly, innovation should not be the only evaluation criterion. In order to better evaluate the entire grant application, we should consider other evaluation scores and establish a more comprehensive system that can predict a grant application based on multiple criteria. Secondly, in the future, this project can also apply some other effective data mining models, such as SVM, AdaBoost, and Xgboost. In addition, the pre-trained language models in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field perform well in understanding text semantics, which can also be our next research focus. Thirdly, our proposed method cannot predict future grant applications because the current data set contains only key terms for 2019 and does not represent future grant applications. Therefore, it is an important research topic to consider building a long-term data mining model to predict future grant applications.",
