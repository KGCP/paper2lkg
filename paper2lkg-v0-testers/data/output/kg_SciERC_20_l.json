    "The problem of blind separation, which involves blindly separating underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals without prior knowledge or assumptions about the original signals. A proposed statistical approach to this problem, known as a separation method, has been shown to be nearly statistically efficient and approaches the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound, assuming the separated signals obey a first-order autoregressive model. This paper proposes a new method for blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals that is piecewise stationary with varying variances in different epochs. The proposed approach relies on nonstationarity of the original signals and has been shown to be more effective than previous works, which were compared with this paper. In fact, it approaches the state-of-the-art methods for blind separation of natural speech signals.",
