    "We propose a new, flexible, and scalable way for generating training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input. This approach uses different view points to reason about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm. To overcome the tedious task of acquiring necessary training data, we use our proposed method which boosts the performance of three learned confidence measures using the KITTI2012 dataset. Our approach has a broader term that involves manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes to acquire the required dataset for training machine learning models. This enables us to generate a huge amount of training data, contributing to outlier removal and quality improvement in stereo vision."
