    "This paper presents a phrase-based statistical machine translation method that deals with such phrases from a word-aligned corpora. The proposed method allows for better generalization from training data and maximizes translation accuracy using non-contiguous phrases or phrases with gaps. This approach uses a beam-search decoder to produce translations, which are then evaluated based on the NIST evaluation metric. In addition, this paper also presents statistical translation models that deal with such phrases and present training methods based on the maximization of translation accuracy."
