  "summary": "In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse . In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them . The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds . The attentional state , being dynamic , records the objects , properties , and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions . The theory of attention , intention , and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses . Various properties of discourse are described , and explanations for the behaviour of cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions are explored . This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse .

    "This paper presents a new theory of discourse structure, which is a framework for understanding the dynamics of discourse through three separate but interrelated components: the linguistic structure, the intentional structure, and the attentional state. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances serves as a specific application of this broader theory, emphasizing the interrelated roles of these components in discourse processing. Within this framework, the intentional structure is identified as a crucial component that captures the purposes relevant to the discourse. Furthermore, the theory of discourse structure stresses the importance of purpose and processing in the organization and interpretation of utterances. This paper also illustrates the theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances, highlighting its composition of the same three interrelated components. Overall, the theory of discourse structure not only presents a comprehensive understanding of discourse but also connects to the broader concept of discourse itself.",
    "The discourse structure encompasses a broader term known as the theory of discourse structure, which is composed of three separate but interrelated components. These components include the intentional structure, which captures discourse-relevant purposes, and the structure of the sequence of utterances. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper, which presents a new theory emphasizing the interrelated components of discourse. This theory, along with the intentional structure, plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of discourse, where the segments of the discourse are organized to reflect the linguistic, intentional, and attentional states of the participants. Overall, the discourse structure is vital for analyzing how utterances aggregate and relate to each other, highlighting the importance of purpose in communication.",
    "The discourse structure encompasses three separate but interrelated components, which include the attentional state, and serves as a broader term for understanding the properties of discourse. This theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is integral to the processing of utterances, highlighting the mechanisms associated with attentional state that track the discourse. Within this framework, the structure of the sequence of utterances is a key component, contributing to the overall discourse. The properties of discourse are described in relation to the discourse itself, illustrating how intention is expressed within it. Additionally, the behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions plays a significant role in shaping the discourse, while segments of the discourse further define its structure. This theory provides a comprehensive framework for describing the processing of utterances, emphasizing the dynamic interactions and purposes that characterize communication.",
    "The segments of the discourse are integral to understanding the broader concept of discourse, as they represent the natural groupings of utterances that form its linguistic structure. In the paper, a framework for describing the processing of utterances is presented, which includes example discourses that illustrate the theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances, all of which fall under the umbrella of Discourse processing. The intentional structure captures the relationships among the intentions expressed in the discourse, highlighting how these intentions are interrelated. Additionally, the attentional state, which is a component of discourse, encompasses the focus of attention of participants, influencing how they track the discourse. The structure of the sequence of utterances, known as linguistic structure, organizes these utterances into coherent segments, contributing to the overall discourse structure. Furthermore, interruptions are acknowledged as phenomena that disrupt the flow of communication, emphasizing the dynamic nature of attentional states within the discourse.",
    "Discourse processing encompasses the broader concept of the discourse, which includes various elements such as properties of discourse and utterances of the discourse. The mechanisms associated with attentional state are integral to understanding the attentional state itself, which plays a crucial role in discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of discourse phenomena, including interruptions and cue phrases. Cue phrases, which help structure the discourse, also fall under the broader term of the discourse. Furthermore, discourse-relevant purposes are expressed within linguistic segments, while the linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse. The framework for describing the processing of utterances serves as a comprehensive model that includes the processing of utterances, tracking the discourse through attentional mechanisms, and recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse. Overall, these relationships highlight the interconnected nature of discourse elements and their significance in effective communication.",
    "In the study of discourse, 'example discourses' encompasses the 'utterances of the discourse', illustrating how these utterances aggregate into meaningful segments. The concept of 'intention' is crucial, as it encompasses 'relationships among intentions', which are essential for understanding the dynamics of discourse. Furthermore, 'intentions expressed in the discourse' also fall under the broader category of 'intention'. The 'attentional state' of participants records the 'relations' that emerge as the discourse unfolds, highlighting the interactions among participants. The 'behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions' is explored in relation to 'interruptions', showcasing how these elements influence discourse flow. Additionally, 'recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments' is a key aspect of the 'processing of utterances', which is vital for effective communication. The 'role of information' derived from discourse plays a significant part in this process. 'Tracking the discourse' is another critical component, as it relates to the 'utterances of the discourse' and is necessary for understanding the overall structure. The 'framework for describing the processing of utterances' is part of the broader field of 'Discourse processing', which requires both 'tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state' and 'recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse'. Lastly, 'referring expressions' are integral to 'the discourse', and understanding 'the distinction among these components' is essential to provide an adequate explanation of their role.",
    "In the study of discourse, interruptions are recognized as a type of utterance that falls under the broader category of utterances of the discourse. Similarly, the properties of discourse are encompassed within the more general concept of properties. Information derived from the discourse is also a subset of the broader category of information. The relationships among various elements in discourse are classified under the term relationships, which includes the relationships among intentions. Discourse processing, which involves the analysis of utterances of the discourse, requires the cognitive task of recognizing how these utterances aggregate into segments. This process is essential for understanding the overall structure of discourse. The attentional state, which captures the focus of attention during discourse, records significant properties and objects relevant to the conversation. Additionally, cue phrases serve as a broader term for discourse phenomena, which also includes interruptions. The linguistic structure of discourse consists of utterances, and the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions is explored in relation to referring expressions, which themselves are categorized under utterances of the discourse.",
    "The role of information has a broader term known as information, which plays a crucial part in discourse processing. Within this context, referring expressions are identified as a broader category under discourse phenomena, highlighting their significance in communication. The focus of attention is inherently linked to participants, as it represents what they are concentrating on during the discourse. Furthermore, the paper, which presents a new theory of discourse structure, falls under the broader category of paper. Participants' knowledge of the domain is another critical aspect, as it encompasses the understanding that individuals possess about a specific subject area, and it is also categorized under participants. Notably, the role of information is derived from participants' knowledge of the domain, emphasizing the interdependence of these concepts. Lastly, participants' knowledge of the domain itself is classified under the broader term domain, illustrating the hierarchical relationship between these elements."
