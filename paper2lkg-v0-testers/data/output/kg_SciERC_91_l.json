    "This paper presents an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games. The process of generating and labeling data at a granular level has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required, particularly when it comes to creating large datasets with pixel-level labels. However, recent progress in computer vision has driven advancements in high-capacity models trained on large datasets, enabling rapid creation of accurate semantic label maps for images obtained from contemporary video games."
