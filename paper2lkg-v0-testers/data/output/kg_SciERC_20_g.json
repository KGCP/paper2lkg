    "This paper presents a separation method that is specifically designed for the blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals. The proposed method is a specific instance of a broader category known as separation methods, which also encompasses techniques for blind separation of natural speech signals. The paper assumes that the signals being analyzed exhibit nonstationarity, which is crucial for effectively addressing the challenges posed by blind separation. The method utilizes a first-order autoregressive model, which has been shown to be more appropriate for the blind separation of natural speech signals. Furthermore, the separation method is statistically efficient, achieving separation accuracy that meets the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound. The paper also discusses how the nonstationarity of the original signals influences the effectiveness of the blind separation process, particularly across different epochs where the statistical properties of the signals may vary.",
    "The assumed model is a specific type of model that is designed to achieve efficient separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals. In this context, the signals are considered to be piecewise stationary, meaning they exhibit varying statistical properties across different epochs. These signals obey a first-order autoregressive model, which captures their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the independent signals that are analyzed are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), but rather they have varying variances in different epochs. The method proposed for separating these signals demonstrates superior separation accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, effectively extracting the separated signals from the mixture while adhering to the assumptions of the assumed model."
