    "A method for automatically collecting statistics on cooccurrence patterns in a large corpus, known as manual acquisition of semantic constraints, was implemented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools. This scheme reflects semantic constraints and thus can be used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities. The collected statistics reflect these semantic constraints and are used for this purpose. An experiment was performed to resolve references of pronouns in sentences randomly selected from a large corpus, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach."
