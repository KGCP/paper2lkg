    "The quality of reference materials or data sources used in natural language processing (NLP) evaluations, which can affect the accuracy and reliability of automatic metrics. Many of these resources are derived from different-quality references that need to be validated especially regarding machine translation (MT) and reference translations. High-quality data is crucial for accurate automatic evaluations within MT systems. Moreover, many language resources used in NLP applications are not specifically designed for this context but are still utilized. The importance or significance of MT and reference translations lies in their broader term as a collection of translated texts or phrases serving as a standard for comparison or evaluation.",
    "This paper describes the impact of using different-quality references on evaluation. The quality of language resources, such as texts or translations, plays a crucial role in NLP applications like Machine Translation and reference translations. Automatic metrics are used within MT to assess performance, but similar scores can be achieved despite varying reference data quality. High-quality data is needed for accurate automatic evaluations, which have a broader impact on the evaluation process."
