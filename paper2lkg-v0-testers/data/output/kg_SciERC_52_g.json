    "Three learned confidence measures significantly boost the performance of learned confidence measures in stereo vision applications. A new, flexible, and scalable way for generating training data enhances the performance of these three learned confidence measures and also overcomes the challenge of acquiring the necessary training data, which is often tedious and time-consuming. This innovative approach requires a set of stereo images and enables the generation of a huge amount of training data, which is produced in a fully automated manner. The three learned confidence measures are trained on automatically generated training data, which has a broader term encompassing the necessary training data. Additionally, these measures are also trained on a limited amount of laser ground truth data, although the automatically generated training data is preferred. The stereo algorithm plays a crucial role by generating multiple depth maps, which are analyzed using the same stereo algorithm to improve the training process. The KITTI2012 dataset is utilized for evaluating the performance of the three learned confidence measures, which gain importance in the context of stereo vision.",
    "Our approach is to use different view points, which enables reasoning about contradictions and consistencies in the context of stereo vision. This methodology leads to a new, flexible, and scalable way for generating training data, which encompasses automatically generated training data and a huge amount of training data. The necessary training data often involves synthetic scenes, active sensing devices, and manual interaction, highlighting the complexities of acquiring quality datasets. Additionally, learned confidence measures gain importance for quality improvement and outlier removal, further enhancing the effectiveness of training data. Multiple depth maps, generated from a set of stereo images, serve as a foundation for this process, allowing for the analysis of depth maps and the identification of inconsistencies and consistencies."
