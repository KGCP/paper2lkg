    "This statistical approach evaluates the performance of the MBR decoders, which report their effectiveness specifically on a Chinese-to-English translation task. The MBR decoders aim to minimize the expected loss of translation errors, utilizing a hierarchy of loss functions that includes specific loss functions tailored for this purpose. These decoders are designed to tune statistical MT performance, thereby enhancing the overall quality of statistical machine translation. The Minimum Bayes-Risk method, which serves as a broader term for this statistical approach, is crucial for decoding in statistical machine translation. Furthermore, the hierarchy of loss functions incorporates various linguistic elements, such as word strings and word-to-word alignments, to optimize translation outcomes. Overall, the performance of the MBR decoders is closely linked to their application in the Chinese-to-English translation task, demonstrating their significance in the field of statistical MT.",
    "Statistical MT is a broader term that encompasses statistical machine translation, a technology that utilizes statistical models for automatic text translation. Within this framework, the hierarchy of loss functions plays a crucial role as it incorporates various types of linguistic information, including syntactic structure derived from parse-trees. The expected loss of translation errors, which quantifies the anticipated costs of translation inaccuracies, is a broader concept that includes translation errors themselves. Additionally, an MT system, which is a type of software for translation, also falls under the umbrella of statistical machine translation. Loss functions are essential as they measure translation performance, providing a criterion for optimization. Furthermore, word-to-word alignments are a broader concept related to MT systems, while parse-trees represent the syntactic structure of source and target language sentences."
