    "Combination methods enhance system combination, which refers to the integration of multiple unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems. This paper examines the benefits of system combination, highlighting its advantages in improving overall performance. Specifically, voting - and arbiter-based combination strategies are investigated over a diverse pool of unsupervised WSD systems, demonstrating their effectiveness. Experiments using the SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets showcase the performance of ensembles, which are collections of combined WSD systems. These ensembles are compared with state-of-the-art methods, illustrating their potential to outperform existing benchmarks. Overall, the benefits of system combination extend to enhancing system performance and contribute to the broader field of WSD."
