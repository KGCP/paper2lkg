  "summary": "Determiners play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance , but they have often been disregarded , perhaps because it seemed more important to devise methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence , even if not in a precise way . Another problem with determiners is their inherent ambiguity . In this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .",

    "The logical formalism is suitable for representing determiners, which play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance. However, their meaning can often be ambiguous, particularly when a particular interpretation is still not clear. This ambiguity is a significant aspect of determiners, as their inherent ambiguity complicates the understanding of utterances. This paper proposes a logical formalism that addresses these challenges, allowing for the representation of determiners without imposing a specific interpretation. Additionally, methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence are considered to be more important than the determiners themselves, as they encompass broader terms related to meaning, including the meaning of an utterance and the concept of ambiguity."
