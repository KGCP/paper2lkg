    "The Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm provides a principled and provable solution for solving specialized regression problems. This unique form of regularization is required to obtain sampling probabilities for records in databases, which enables efficient evaluation of aggregate queries. The proposed cost-zero solution has no computational resources or costs, making it an attractive approach. However, this solution always exists unless excluded by hard budget constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm can generalize well to unseen data due to a theoretical generalization result. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in solving specialized regression problems.",
    "Standard regression problems are a type of statistical problem that involves estimating relationships between variables using linear models. This can be seen as a broader term for all types of problems, including regression problems. In databases, we often evaluate aggregate queries over small sets of records to retrieve specific information efficiently and accurately. A principled and provable solution is required to solve these problems effectively. Experimental results provide the outcome of such evaluations, which are based on theoretical generalization results."
