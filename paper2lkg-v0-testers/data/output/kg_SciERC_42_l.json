    "A language learning experiment showed that assessors can differentiate native from non-native language essays in less than 100 words. This experiment tested whether similar criteria could be elicited by duplicating it using machine translation output, demonstrating the ability of evaluators to distinguish between expert human translations and MT outputs within a short time frame. The purpose of this research was conducted in order to test the efficacy of applying automated evaluation techniques originally designed for human language learners to machine translation systems.",
    "The first experiment in a series of experiments, which looks at the intelligibility of machine translation output. The factors on which assessors made their decisions were elicited from duplicating the experiment using machine translation outputs and similar criteria. Some extracts were expert human translations, while others were machine translation outputs. This research aims to test the efficacy of applying automated evaluation techniques originally designed for human language learners to machine translation systems. The development of these systems is crucial in evaluating comprehensibility of MT output.",
    "The translation process involves expert human translations, which are produced by humans with expertise in language processing. The factors that influence how assessors make judgments about language proficiency were identified as criteria or evaluation metrics used to measure or evaluate something. In a recent experiment, subjects were given three minutes per extract and a set of up to six extracts of translated newswire text to analyze the word at which they decide whether it's an expert human translation or not. The results of this experiment, along with a preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision making process will be presented here."
