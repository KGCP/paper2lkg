    "The second half of the paper utilizes the Wizard of Oz technique, which is employed to evaluate the specific task of data retrieval. This section reports on the task dialogues collected using this technique, which identifies the natural language requirements necessary for effectively carrying out the task. The Wizard of Oz technique, a broader term for the technique itself, is instrumental in identifying these NL requirements. Furthermore, the evaluation of Natural Language systems encompasses various approaches that have been used to assess their effectiveness, with a focus on future Natural Language systems. The requirements identified through this laboratory study, which uses the Wizard of Oz technique, are essential for the development of prototype Natural Language systems that can meet the demands of complex data retrieval tasks.",
    "This paper presents a critical discussion that highlights the shortcomings of previous approaches in evaluating Natural Language systems. From the task that we gave our subjects, three important requirements arose, which include the need for complex contextual references. These requirements have a broader term known as requirements, which are essential for the effective functioning of Natural Language systems. The prototype Natural Language system, which is a preliminary version of such systems, is evaluated in the context of task dialogues that place specific demands upon it. Future Natural Language systems, which are designed to meet these requirements, are also categorized under the broader term systems. However, previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems within the context of their use, raising questions about the validity of such approaches. The task that we gave our subjects is a specific task requiring data retrieval, emphasizing the importance of understanding the requirements for effective data retrieval in Natural Language systems.",
    "The concept of complex contextual reference is encompassed within the broader category of requirements, which also includes operators specific to the task of database access. Task dialogues, which are structured interactions aimed at accomplishing specific tasks, fall under the general term task. A critical discussion evaluates the various approaches used in assessing Natural Language systems, raising important questions about the validity of such approaches. This discussion highlights the need for requirements that include a reference to the structure of the information source, which is essential for effective data retrieval. Furthermore, the second half of the paper elaborates on a task requiring data retrieval, emphasizing the significance of database access as a broader task category. Overall, these elements underscore the intricate relationships between requirements, tasks, and the methodologies employed in Natural Language system evaluations."
