    "The approach proposes a novel approach that is specifically designed to facilitate camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios. This novel approach is used to perform camera handoff, allowing for seamless tracking of objects across multiple PTZ cameras. It demonstrates the capability to associate objects effectively, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that relied on geometric, appearance, or correlation-based information. In this context, the slave camera follows the target by bootstrapping itself from incoming imagery, thus enhancing tracking capabilities without direct control from a master camera. The approach is applicable to wide-area surveillance scenarios, where multiple PTZ camera sequences are utilized to ensure comprehensive monitoring.",
    "The approach demonstrates a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, which serve as a broader term encompassing this novel method. Incoming imagery, which refers to the visual data captured by a slave camera, has a broader term known as imagery. The logistic softmax function is applied to covariance-based region features, which are essential for enhancing object association in surveillance systems. Furthermore, Multiple Instance Learning is based on these covariance-based region features and utilizes the logistic softmax function within a MAP estimation framework. In practical applications, multiple PTZ camera sequences effectively demonstrate outdoor surveillance settings and show a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. However, previous approaches have limitations that restrict their effectiveness in wide-area surveillance scenarios."
