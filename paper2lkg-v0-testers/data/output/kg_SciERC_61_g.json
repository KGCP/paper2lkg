    "This paper proposes a multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network, referred to as the proposed model, which addresses the problem of online action detection. The proposed model is designed to evaluate and build a large streaming video dataset, demonstrating promising performance in accurately detecting and localizing actions. This network, which is synonymous with the proposed model, is capable of localizing the start and end points of actions, effectively capturing complex long-range temporal dynamics. The problem of online action detection involves the use of streaming skeleton data and is a broader term that encompasses the field of Human action recognition. Overall, this paper studies the challenges associated with online action detection and presents a robust solution through the proposed model.",
    "The proposed model ensures high computational efficiency, allowing for effective processing of streaming skeleton data. This scheme demonstrates promising performance, which is evidenced by our dataset that also showcases similar results. Online action detection identifies action types and localizes action positions, operating from an untrimmed stream, and is a broader term under the field of Human action recognition. The multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network proposes the Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network, which explores action types while having a broader term as a model. Additionally, promising performance has a broader term known as performance, and both the G3D dataset and our dataset demonstrate this promising performance. Human action recognition has been studied using well-segmented 3D skeleton data, which is attracting increasing attention in the research community. The deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) subnetwork, which is a broader term under the model category, plays a crucial role in capturing complex temporal dynamics in the data.",
    "Well-segmented 3D skeleton data is a specific type of 3D skeleton data that accurately represents human skeletal structures. Within the realm of action detection, the subtask of regression optimization plays a crucial role by providing the ability to forecast the action prior to its occurrence, which enhances the predictive capabilities of models. The action type, which refers to the classification of human actions, is a broader concept under the classification umbrella. Our dataset, which is a large streaming video dataset, falls under the broader category of datasets, as does the G3D dataset and the streaming video dataset. Additionally, regression optimization is essential for enabling the ability to forecast actions, which is a key aspect of forecasting in this context. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, particularly the deep LSTM subnetwork, are instrumental in processing these data types."
