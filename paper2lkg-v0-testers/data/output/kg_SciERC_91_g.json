    "This paper presents an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps, which is specifically designed for images extracted from modern computer games. This approach is a broader method that creates pixel-accurate semantic label maps, enabling detailed semantic categorization of visual content. The images extracted from modern computer games serve as a foundation for generating these precise label maps and are categorized under the broader term 'images'. However, the process of creating large datasets with pixel-level labels is challenging, as it requires significant human effort, making it a costly endeavor. This human effort has historically hindered the efficient generation of such datasets. Meanwhile, recent progress in computer vision has been driven by high-capacity models, which are trained on large datasets to enhance the capabilities of computer vision systems."
