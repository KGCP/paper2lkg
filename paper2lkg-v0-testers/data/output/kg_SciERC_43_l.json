    "Our heuristic principles guide machine learning approach to bare slice disambiguation in dialogue, yielding the results. These principles have significant predictive power and are formulated as probabilistic Horn clauses. We extract a set of heuristic principles from a corpus-based sample and formulate them as probabilistic Horn clauses, which has broader implications for Horn clauses. Both learners yield similar success rates of approximately 90%. This paper presents a machine learning approach to bare slice disambiguation in dialogue that uses the predicates of such clauses. The results are presented with domain-independent features having broader implications for sets and papers."
