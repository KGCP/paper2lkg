    "The GLOSSER software program supports various language pairs, including English-Bulgarian and English-Hungarian for translation. It also enables reading and learning to read in a foreign language. Additionally, it provides support for other language pairs such as English-Estonian and French-Dutch. Notably, the GLOSSER is itself supported by a broader program that operates on platforms like UNIX."
