    "A novel approach to associate objects across multiple PTZ cameras that can be used to perform camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios proposes a Multiple Instance Learning formulation for the problem based on the logistic softmax function of covariance-based region features within a MAP estimation framework. This approach uses slave cameras, which follow targets while loosely registering with master cameras, bootstrapping themselves from their own incoming imagery. The proposed method enables seamless camera switching in outdoor surveillance settings by associating objects across multiple PTZ camera sequences. In particular, the approach performs camera handoff and associates objects, demonstrating its effectiveness for wide-area surveillance scenarios."
