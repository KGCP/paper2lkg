    "This paper proposes to use a convolution kernel over parse trees, which effectively captures syntactic structure information for relation extraction. Our method outperforms previous two dependency tree kernels and reveals that the syntactic structure features embedded in a parse tree are very effective for this purpose. The proposed approach uses a convolutional operation over parse trees to model these features, significantly improving upon previous best-reported feature-based methods."
