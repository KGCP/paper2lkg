    "The proposed methods, which include the n-gram TM, are evaluated through transliteration and backtransliteration experiments. This paper presents a novel framework for machine transliteration and backtransliteration that allows for direct orthographical mapping between two different languages. The n-gram TM, also known as the n-gram transliteration model, is a joint source-channel transliteration model that enhances the transliteration process. The study reveals that the proposed method improves transliteration accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in facilitating direct orthographical mapping. Additionally, the framework is associated with the concept of DOM, which supports the transliteration process across various languages.",
    "The transliteration/backtransliteration experiments are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel framework for machine transliteration/backtransliteration, specifically focusing on English/Chinese and English/Japanese language pairs. These experiments highlight the importance of the transliteration process, which encompasses various methods, including the joint source-channel transliteration model and the n-gram transliteration model. The proposed method aims to reduce system development effort while enhancing the accuracy of the transliteration process. Furthermore, machine transliteration/back-transliteration plays a crucial role in multilingual speech and language applications, demonstrating its significance in the broader context of languages.",
    "The n-gram transliteration model is a specific type of method that falls under the broader category of methods used in various fields. This statistical approach in natural language processing utilizes sequences of n characters or words to effectively convert text from one script to another."
