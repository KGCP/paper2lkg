    "This paper examines the benefits of system combination for unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation, which has a broader term encompassing WSD systems and techniques. Our combination methods derive automatically from raw text and are an effective way of improving system performance. The benefits of combining multiple systems for performing Word Sense Disambiguation without supervision have been demonstrated through experiments that yield significantly better results when compared with the state-of-the-art."
