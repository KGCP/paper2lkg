    "The unlexicalized parser for German, which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2, uses this technique as part of its parsing process. This model has been shown to be effective in achieving high accuracy, with previously reported results on the NEGRA corpus indicating a strong performance. The methodology used by this parser is presented in a paper that reports these findings."
