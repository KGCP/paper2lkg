First , we investigate how well the addressee of a dialogue act can be predicted based on gaze , utterance and conversational context features . Then , we explore whether information about meeting context can aid classifiers ' performances . Both classifiers perform the best when conversational context and utterance features are combined with speaker 's gaze information . The classifiers show little gain from information about meeting context .",

    "In their research, both Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers demonstrated superior performance when combining conversational context, utterance features, and speaker's gaze information. The results show that these machine learning models can effectively identify the intended recipient in face-to-face meetings with four participants. While we present our findings on addressee identification using these algorithms, it is clear that they have broader implications for understanding how to predict the addressee of a dialogue act based on various features such as gaze, utterance, and conversational context."
