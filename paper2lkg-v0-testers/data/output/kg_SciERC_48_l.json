    "The problem of learning to predict moves in Go from game records of expert players would be effective as a move selector and move sorter for game tree search, as well as a training tool for Go players. This distribution has numerous applications in computer Go, including serving as an efficient stand-alone Go player. We investigate the problem by obtaining a probability distribution over legal moves for professional play in a given position. Our method consists of two major components: a pattern extraction scheme and a Bayesian learning algorithm trained on 181,000 expert games. The system is designed to learn from these records and predict moves made by professional players with excellent performance.",
    "A probability distribution over legal moves for professional play in a given position represents a mathematical representation of possible moves that an expert Go player would make. This distribution has a broader term, which is simply a statistical pattern or arrangement of values. Similarly, stand-alone Go players and efficient ones alike are systems designed to analyze and make predictions about complex games like Go. These systems have a broader term as well, which is just another way of saying method. Furthermore, the process of extracting patterns from data can be done using various methods, including pattern extraction schemes that also fall under this broader category."
