    "The retrieval process enhances topical blog post retrieval by incorporating textual credibility indicators, which are essential for evaluating the relevance of blog posts. This process is fundamentally about ranking blog posts based on their relevance for a given topic. Within this context, there are two groups of indicators that consider both post level and blog level metrics. These indicators are integrated into a retrieval approach that utilizes a broader term known as indicators. Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set demonstrate that credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness. The best performance in these experiments is achieved when combining both post-level and blog-level indicators. Specifically, post-level indicators are determined using information about individual blog posts, while blog-level indicators are derived from the underlying blogs. Overall, the integration of these credibility indicators plays a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of the retrieval process.",
    "Individual blog posts are a specific category within the broader term of blog posts, which encompass various written articles published on online platforms. The retrieval approach utilized for topical blog post retrieval is based on language models, which are designed to understand and generate human language. Additionally, underlying blogs serve as the foundational sources that inform the credibility assessment of blog posts, and they too fall under the broader category of blogs."
