    "This paper presents our approach for using information extraction annotations to augment document retrieval for distillation. Our method takes advantage of the fact that some of the distillation queries can be associated with annotation elements introduced for the NIST Automatic Content Extraction task, which significantly improves precision at various recall rates for two different query templates. We experimentally show that using ACE events to constrain the document set returned by an information retrieval engine also achieves similar improvements in precision. This paper augments document retrieval and presents our approach as a methodology used to improve the precision of retrieved documents in information distillation tasks, achieved by constraining the document set with ACE events from an information retrieval engine."
