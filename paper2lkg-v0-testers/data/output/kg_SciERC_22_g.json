    "The compact lexicon is consistent with CCG principles, reflecting the theoretical constructs of Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The Turkish dependency treebank, which serves as a linguistic resource, has a broader term of dependency treebank, as well as treebank. Notably, Combinatory Categorial Grammar is induced from the Turkish dependency treebank, showcasing its foundational role in this context. Additionally, the treebank itself has a broader term of dependency treebank, while the Penn WSJ, another significant linguistic resource, also falls under the broader category of dependency treebank. It is worth noting that the treebank is smaller than the Penn WSJ, which further emphasizes the latter's extensive nature. Furthermore, the Penn WSJ has a broader term of treebank, indicating its comprehensive scope in linguistic annotation."
