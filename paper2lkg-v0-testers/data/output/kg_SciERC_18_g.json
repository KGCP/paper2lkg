    "This research is part of this paper, which presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressions in English. The paper discusses the implications for current discourse processing algorithms, highlighting how these findings may influence the design and functionality of such algorithms. Furthermore, this research is also part of a larger study of anaphoric expressions, which investigates the distribution of demonstrative forms and functions across various texts. This distribution is genre dependent, indicating that the usage of demonstrative expressions varies across different genres. The broader terms associated with the distribution include demonstrative expressions in English, demonstrative forms, and functions, all of which play a crucial role in understanding how language operates in context. Additionally, the texts analyzed in this study show how the distribution of demonstrative forms and functions can be observed, further linking demonstrative expressions in English to discourse processing algorithms.",
    "A larger study of anaphoric expressions encompasses various aspects of research, including the investigation of anaphoric expressions themselves. This research is part of a broader initiative that aims to analyze the usage of demonstrative expressions within a broad range of texts, which are essential for understanding their distribution in English. The findings from this study will ultimately be incorporated into a natural language generation system, enhancing its ability to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text. Demonstrative expressions, which are integral to maintaining clarity in communication, are specifically used in the context of English, highlighting the linguistic nuances that this research seeks to explore."
