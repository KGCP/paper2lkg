    "This paper highlights reference problems, which are a type of misunderstandings that occur when there is failure to understand the speaker's intention or referential meaning. The authors describe various kinds of miscommunication between speakers and listeners, including reference failures or failure to understand intentions. They recognize and isolate such mistakes, which can lead to misunderstandings between speakers and listeners. Furthermore, they propose techniques for avoiding these failures of reference.",
    "This research paper, 'The Paper', promotes a new view for extensional reference. The concept of miscommunication in human-machine interactions highlights the importance of recognizing and isolating such misunderstandings between speaker and listener. In fact, various kinds of misunderstandings can occur when a listener interprets a speaker's utterance incorrectly, leading to difficulties or mistakes in communication. Our goal is to recognize, isolate, and avoid these misunderstandings through natural language processing. The primary objective of this research is to enhance human-machine interactions in natural language environments by allowing speakers leeway in forming an utterance about a task and determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it.",
    "The novel approach to human-machine interaction, characterized by allowing speakers more flexibility in forming utterances and selecting conversational vehicles, can be seen as an extension of a broader framework. This framework provides guidelines for organizing or understanding something, which also serves as the foundation for another concept known as extensional reference."
