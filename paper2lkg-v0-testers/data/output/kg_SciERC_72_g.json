    "A unified account of sentence-level and text-level anaphora operates within the framework of a dependency-based grammar model, providing insights into text-level anaphora. This text-level anaphora incorporates the Grosz-Sidner-style focus model, which aids in understanding how references are structured across sentences. Furthermore, both the unified account and text-level anaphora share a broader term, which is anaphora. Anaphora resolution plays a crucial role in this context, as it rephrases major concepts from GB's binding theory, highlighting the relationships between pronouns and their antecedents. Additionally, sentence boundaries are relevant for anaphora resolution, as they define the limits of individual sentences, and they also rephrase major concepts from GB's binding theory, emphasizing the importance of structure in linguistic references."
