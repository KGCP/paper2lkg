    "This paper proposes a new method for background modeling and scene subtraction when dealing with persistent dynamic behavior in time. The proposed approach utilizes optical flow as a feature in a higher dimensional space to model and subtract scenes that exhibit such behavior. When the scene exhibits persistent dynamic behavior, traditional approaches can deteriorate detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a new method for the modeling and subtraction of such scenes. This methodology is an important component of many vision systems.",
    "Background modeling has a broader term, proposed approach. The process of creating comprehensive representations of environments often employs optical flow, which measures apparent motion between consecutive frames. This technique falls under the umbrella of method. Kernels are mathematical functions used to transform input values and can be part of this broader category. Existing work has mostly addressed scenes that consist of static or quasi-static structures, but also touches on general scenes. In contrast, our proposed approach focuses on more dynamic environments. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments, which have a broader term in the realm of scientific trials. Our paper proposes method as a solution to this problem."
