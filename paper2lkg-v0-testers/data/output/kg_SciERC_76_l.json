    "The general method involves using automatic segmentation of raw corpora with word lists, manual correction of sentences, and building models from segmented corpora. This situation can be described as build a model from the segmented corpus. The general method concentrates on correcting positions where words in the list appear, allowing for direct capture of statistical word behaviors. Our method allows us to avoid these problems by proposing to concentrate on correcting grammatically complicated positions during sentence-by-sentence error correction. In this paper, we propose to focus on language model adaptation methods that allow us to correct the positions in which the words in the list appear.",
    "The raw corpus, which serves as input for linguistic analysis, can be processed using various methods. For instance, sentence-by-sentence error correction method and language model adaptation methods are techniques used to correct grammatically complicated positions within sentences. However, these problems result in a decrease of productivity when correcting errors manually. In this paper, we propose our method for preparing a segmented corpus, which enables efficient processing of large datasets. The results demonstrate the benefits of adapting language models for specific tasks and domains."
