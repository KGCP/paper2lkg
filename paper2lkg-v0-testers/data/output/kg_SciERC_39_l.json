    "The Wizard of Oz technique was used to identify three important requirements that arose from giving subjects tasks requiring data retrieval, such as database access. These NL requirements have a broader term, Natural Language systems, which require operators specific to the task and complex contextual reference. The second half of this paper reports on these findings. In contrast, previous approaches in evaluating Natural Language systems have neglected to evaluate them in the context of their use, e.g., solving tasks requiring data retrieval. Future Natural Language systems will potentially satisfy requirements for solving such tasks.",
    "In this study, we evaluated the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique place upon a prototype Natural Language system. Our analysis revealed NL requirements for carrying out tasks such as data retrieval, including complex contextual references and operators specific to database access. These findings highlight the need for systems to understand and navigate complex information structures. In contrast to previous approaches, our study has neglected to evaluate these demands on existing systems. Instead, we focused on identifying NL requirements that can inform the development of more effective Natural Language processing technologies."
