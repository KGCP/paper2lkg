    "Our method proposes a convex problem to incorporate side information into robust principal component analysis (PCA) and shows that low-rank matrices can be exactly recovered via this approach under certain conditions. This novel, convex approach improves upon current methods by considering both prior structure and features of entities for recovery in the presence of noise or outliers. The effectiveness of incorporating side information is theoretically justified, demonstrating its usefulness in many machine learning applications where robust PCA is applied.",
    "Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with side information has been considered in many machine learning applications. The effectiveness of features in robust PCA justifies that a substantial amount of low rank matrices, which cannot be recovered by standard robust PCA, become re-coverable by our proposed method. Our guarantee suggests that these low rank matrices can be exactly recovered via the proposed method under certain conditions. This paper theoretically justifies the effectiveness of incorporating side information and features in Robust Principal Component Analysis methods. In contrast to current approaches developed only considering a low-rank plus sparse structure, our proposed method becomes re-coverable by low rank matrix. Moreover, noisy image classification has been considered as one of machine learning applications."
