    "Our method is an enhancement of the method designed to accelerate the evaluation of object detection cascades. It speeds up the search process and integrates a divide-and-conquer procedure that operates in the space of candidate regions. Compared to the exhaustive procedure, which is the state-of-the-art for cascade evaluation, our method demonstrates significant improvements. The last stage of our method can incorporate efficient subwindow search, which has a broader term as a method. Additionally, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset shows an acceleration of more than 50% when using our method. This method also utilizes kernel-ized support vector machines within the branch-and-bound object detection framework, which employs nonlinear quality functions to enhance performance."
