This formalism, which characterizes correspondences between languages, presents a challenge for extending Tree-Adjoining Grammars beyond syntax proper. We discuss concrete examples that demonstrate the use of TAGs in semantic interpretation and automatic translation of natural language, mentioning primarily in passing some computational issues that arise during their interpretation."
