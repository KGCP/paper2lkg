    "This paper presents a novel system designed to acquire adjectival subcategorization frames (scfs) and their frequency information from English corpus data. The system achieves a 66% recall rate and is capable of detecting scfs effectively. It utilizes a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grammatical relations into hierarchical frames, which are essential for understanding the structure of adjectives in sentences. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the system achieves a precision of 70%. Furthermore, the novel system incorporates a decision-tree classifier, enhancing its ability to analyze and categorize data. Overall, this paper describes a comprehensive tool that not only acquires scfs but also provides valuable frequency information, contributing significantly to the field of linguistic annotation.",
    "The concept of frames hierarchically encompasses adjectival subcategorization frames, which are essential for understanding how adjectives function within sentences. A powerful pattern-matching language serves as a tool that aids in the classification of these frames, while a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames utilizes English corpus data to extract relevant information. This system is supported by a robust statistical parser, which is a type of tool designed to analyze grammatical structures. Additionally, the new tool for linguistic annotation of subcategorization frames is introduced as a tool for linguistic annotation, streamlining the process of gathering training and test data for subcategorization acquisition. The experiments conducted demonstrate a precision of 70%, indicating the effectiveness of the decision-tree classifier in testing for the presence of grammatical relations within the output of the statistical parser."
