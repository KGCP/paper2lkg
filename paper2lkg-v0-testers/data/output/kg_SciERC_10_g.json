    "This paper proposes and presents a generic mathematical formalism that serves as a framework for combining various structures, which include strings, trees, directed acyclic graphs (dags), and graphs. This formalism is a specific instance of the broader term 'formalism' and is designed to control the saturation of the final structure through the polarization of the objects of the elementary structures. The polarization not only influences the saturation but also falls under the broader category of structures. Furthermore, this formalism strongly simulates grammar formalisms, which are also encompassed by the term formalism. The products of the various structures formed through this formalism are categorized under products, indicating their mathematical significance. Additionally, grammar formalisms include rewriting systems and Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG), both of which are foundational concepts in the study of formal languages.",
    "Grammar formalisms encompass a wide range of structured systems used to define and analyze languages, and they have a broader term known as mathematical formalism. Within the realm of grammar formalisms, several specific frameworks are included, such as HPSG, dependency grammars, and LFG. Each of these frameworks, including HPSG, which emphasizes the role of heads in syntactic structures, and dependency grammars, which focus on the relationships between words, falls under the broader category of grammar formalisms. Additionally, LFG is another important framework that contributes to the understanding of syntax and semantics in natural languages, further illustrating the comprehensive nature of grammar formalisms."
