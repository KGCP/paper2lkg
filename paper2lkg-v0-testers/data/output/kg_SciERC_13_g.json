  "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun . In Thai language , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun . Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .",

    "This paper presents and describes an algorithm that generates Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) from a large corpus. The algorithm focuses on selecting the appropriate classifier word for each noun in the Thai language, addressing the variability in classifier choice among individual speakers. It utilizes a corpus-based method to create these associations, which are constrained by concept hierarchy constraints. The process of Registration of classifier is limited to unit classifiers and is influenced by a default rule that picks up a corresponding classifier for each noun. Furthermore, both Noun Classifier Associations and the algorithm are categorized under broader terms such as classifier and algorithm, respectively. The relationship between each noun and its corresponding classifier highlights the lack of an exact rule for classifier selection, emphasizing the contextual nature of classifier usage.",
    "The rule-based approach gives rise to the default rule, which serves as a guideline for classifier selection in the Thai language. Within this framework, the classifier is a broader term that encompasses the algorithm used for selecting appropriate classifiers. Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) are recomposed under the frequency of occurrences, highlighting the statistical nature of classifier selection. Additionally, other types of classifiers are open due to their representation, indicating variability in choice. The classifier fluctuates in its selection for each concrete noun, which is a specific instance of a noun. A large corpus, which has a broader term of corpus, plays a crucial role in this process, as it provides the linguistic data necessary for analysis. The speech community influences the classifier choices, reflecting the dynamic nature of language use. Furthermore, concept hierarchy constraints, which have a broader term of concept hierarchy, guide the organization of noun classifier associations, ensuring that the relationships between concepts are maintained. Overall, each noun, which also has a broader term of noun, is subject to these various influences and classifications."
