  "summary": "Abstract\u2014As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager. For a completely independent open source computing system, open source RISC-V hardware architecture provides the freedom that is needed.\n\nRISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that offers a more secure and efficient alternative to traditional processors, focusing on basic computational operations and optimized instruction implementation. It allows for extensions and improvements by industry experts, fostering a collaborative ecosystem. Despite historical challenges in open-source hardware, RISC-V has gained traction with contributions from major institutions worldwide. MILIS Linux, a unique distribution initiated in 2016, aims to create a free and user-friendly operating system, independent of existing distributions. The project is now developing a fork to support RISC-V architecture, targeting embedded devices and IoT applications, thus promoting open-source operating systems in the context of Industry 4.0.\n\nSiFive has developed several motherboards for RISC-V processors, leading to increased support for Linux distributions. Legacy distributions like Debian are porting to RISC-V, while Fedora is creating a native OS and a web-based compilation tracking system. Buildroot has also been adapted for 64-bit RISC-V architecture. This paper focuses on enhancing kernel support and reducing porting times through a reference implementation based on MILIS, aiming to build a Linux from Scratch and improve user-space application levels.\n\nMILIS Linux is successfully running on 64-bit systems, focusing on RISC-V architecture. The project aims to create kernel and userspace packages for a 64-bit little-endian RISC-V system, with future considerations for 32-bit and 128-bit variants. Key components include: A. System Emulation using QEMU for development without hardware; B. Toolchain with GCC 9.1 and Binutils 2.32, utilizing Glibc 2.29 for RISC-V support; C. Bootloader options like Berkley Bootloader (BBL) for kernel execution, which requires rebuilding with the kernel; D. Ongoing work on various kernel and userspace tasks since RISC-V Linux was accepted into the Linux tree in 2017; E. Cross-compilation of packages to create a bootable operating system; F. Creation of a bootable image from MILIS packages for distribution. The overall process aims to establish a functional RISC-V computing environment.\n\nThis paper discusses the RISC-V processor, highlighting its potential due to its open-source, community-driven design, making it suitable for mission-critical projects, especially in the Internet of Things. Many companies are investing in R&D for RISC-V, joining the RISC-V foundation. The paper emphasizes the need for a reliable open-source operating system, with Linux as the ideal kernel. While port migration of Linux distributions is underway, there is a call to develop a robust user ecosystem on the Linux kernel through the MILIS Linux project. This initiative aims to enhance the IT process and will benefit from the open computing proposal.\n\nA. Physical Implementation and Optimizations The work outline performed on the QEMU virtual machine discussed in this study will be applied on a real board based on RISC-V processor. Compilation and testing will give more accurate results using physical hardware. Thus, we will have a better understanding of the components that will need to be optimized. The compilation tools that we use in the bootstrap process will offer more RISC-V support over time and will be optimized. In addition, alternative libraries instead of Glibc, which we currently use as C libraries, will be evaluated. Also, with the RISC-V support in the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure [31], native compile support will be increased at the level of programming languages which use LLVM as back-end compiler. RISC-V porting will be further explored for the kernel level difficulties encountered while providing the necessary solutions. The necessary sponsors and research project funding supports will be provided for the R&D studies and RISC-V processors with different features will be obtained and the studies will be performed on real equipment.\n\nB. The Future: Open Hardware and Open Source Operating System Open hardware means license-free; namely with RISC-V virtually anyone can produce potentially better evaluations and much more accurate comparisons with existing works. There is a range of high quality, open-source RISC-V implementations to modify, rather than just based on estimating or simulations. Also opening standard will bring about a more active development community so that when sharing patches or ideas, projects will get contributions more quickly. As of now one aspect of the RISC-V Foundation is responding to proposals and discussing them. The other aspect is producing proposed changes either in a future specification revision or in hardware. On the other hand, opening the standards and having a commercially open license would certainly make the processor design and production race more fair. Also RISC-V will bring a new synergy of open source computer architecture research areas, such as universities started to establish research groups on RISC-V, such as OpenCelerity [32] and SCARV [33]. Research is expected to be carried out on real hardware with the increase of RISC-V processor manufacturers. As a result, Linux kernel and userspace seems the best candidate software stack for RISC-V.",
