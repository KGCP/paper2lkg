    "Our method, which uses our detectors to capture distinctive textured patterns and large-scale structures with strong invariance to rotation, illumination variation, and blur. This approach can find image regions that present a distinct distribution in their neighborhood by incorporating histogram-based representations. A new method for detecting interest points using histogram information is also presented, capable of identifying key features or locations. Additionally, we extend our method to space-time interest point detection for action classification, demonstrating the versatility of this technique."
