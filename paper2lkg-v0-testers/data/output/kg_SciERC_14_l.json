    "In this paper, we explore what can be said about transparent objects by a moving observer. We present a novel model-based approach to recover the shapes and poses of transparent objects from known motion. This approach shows how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene. Moreover, we have applied it to real scenes that include transparent objects and recovered the shapes of the objects with high accuracy. However, detecting the presence of transparent objects in the scene is difficult even when given a single image.",
    "In this paper, we explore what can be said about transparent objects by a moving observer. The concept of exploring and understanding the properties and behaviors of transparent objects as perceived from images taken by a moving observer has been studied extensively in computer vision. Our algorithm uses a model-based approach to recover shapes and poses of transparent objects from known motion. We have conducted numerous simulations to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The perception of shapes and poses of transparent objects is known to be a very hard problem in vision, but by using a single image or multiple images taken at different angles, we can gain insights into this complex phenomenon."
