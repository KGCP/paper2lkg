    "This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for using demonstrative expressions in English, discussing their implications on discourse processing algorithms. The study also explores how the distribution of demonstrative forms and functions varies depending on genre. Furthermore, it outlines the results that will be incorporated into a natural language generation system to facilitate communication. As part of this research, we examine a broad range of texts to better understand anaphoric expressions."
