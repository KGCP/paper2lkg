    "Unconstrained MPS grammars are not computationally safe, which highlights a significant limitation in their application. These grammars are a part of metagrammatical formalisms that combine metarules and context-free phrase structure rules, allowing for the formulation of generalizations about the syntax of natural languages. Various proposals have been put forward to constrain these unconstrained MPS grammars, aiming to enhance their computational tractability and explanatory adequacy. However, several proposals have evaluated these suggestions, and none of them satisfies both criteria of computational tractability and explanatory adequacy. The generalizations about the syntax of natural languages encompass broader terms such as syntax and natural languages, indicating the complexity of the relationships involved. Furthermore, new directions for research are being explored to address the limitations of current metagrammatical formalisms, emphasizing the ongoing need for advancements in this field."
