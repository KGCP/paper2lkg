    "Our proposed system applies ambiguity packing and stochastic disambiguation techniques for Lexical-Functional Grammars (LFG) to sentence condensation, ensuring guaranteed grammaticality of its output. This innovative approach incorporates a linguistic parser/generator for LFG, a transfer component for parse reduction operating on packed parse forests, and a maximum-entropy model for stochastic output selection. By leveraging these techniques, our system achieves state-of-the-art summarization quality while guaranteeing the grammatical correctness of its outputs.",
    "The proposed system, which condenses sentences using packed parse forests and transfer components for parse reduction, achieves state-of-the-art overall summarization quality. This quality can be evaluated through both automatic parse-based evaluation methods that correlate with manual assessment of generated strings."
