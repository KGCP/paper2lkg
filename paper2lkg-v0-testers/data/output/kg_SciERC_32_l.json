    "In their presentation, 'Based on these results', researchers demonstrated how embodied conversational agents (ECAs) can update dialogue states using verbal and nonverbal grounding acts. ECAs utilize both verbal and nonverbal behaviors to establish common ground with humans during human-computer interaction. Interestingly, the type of dialogue move being grounded affects the use of nonverbal behaviors, such as head nods, which are a broader term for nonverbal behaviors that convey meaning without spoken language. The researchers investigated the verbal and nonverbal means for grounding these moves, finding that they differed depending on the type of dialogue move being grounded. Their analysis reflected a monitoring of lack of negative feedback in this process."
