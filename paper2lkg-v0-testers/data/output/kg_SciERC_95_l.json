    "This paper proposes extending to a context-dependent one, which associates with a text input based on statistical learning. We have previously introduced a statistical model describing the generating process of speech F0 contours, allowing us to derive an efficient algorithm for estimating Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours. The present model is built upon this foundation and uses decision tree-based context clustering to train its parameters. By leveraging powerful statistical methods, we can efficiently estimate the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours.",
    "A decision tree-based context clustering technique uses algorithms to group and analyze data contexts. This approach has a broader term, which is an algorithm itself. Similarly, parameter training algorithms are also types of algorithms that refine their performance. Statistical models can be viewed as another type of algorithm used to describe complex phenomena. In the field of research, papers often deal with specific problems, providing insights into how these challenges can be addressed."
