    "This paper compares these models, which refer to three comparative models of an incremental probabilistic parser that incorporate syntactic priming. It describes a method for incorporating priming into an incremental probabilistic parser, enhancing parsing accuracy by utilizing previously encountered structures. Syntactic priming, a psycholinguistic phenomenon, is identified as the tendency to repeat structures, and it has a broader term known as priming. The three models are compared in the context of priming of rules between sentences, which involves both within sentences and between sentences. These models simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving overall parsing accuracy. Additionally, the priming of rules between sentences also involves within coordinate structures, further illustrating the complexity of syntactic priming. The psycholinguistic literature provides evidence for the significance of syntactic priming, which is associated with various structures, including parallel structures.",
    "The priming of rules is a cognitive process that involves both coordinate structures and sentences. This process highlights how certain syntactic structures, particularly those that are equal in importance and often connected by conjunctions, are more likely to be reused in subsequent sentences, thereby influencing language processing and comprehension."
