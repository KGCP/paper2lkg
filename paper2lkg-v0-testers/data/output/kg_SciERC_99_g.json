    "This paper introduces a novel approach that presents a novel representation for three-dimensional objects, which is particularly applicable to cluttered scenes. The approach combines multi-view constraints with a normalized representation, facilitating matching and reconstruction processes that allow the acquisition of three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models. Notably, this novel representation is designed for three-dimensional objects and does not require a separate segmentation stage, streamlining the process of recognition and modeling. Preliminary modeling and recognition results are presented, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach in generating recognition results and demonstrating the broader term of modeling. The normalized representation guides the matching and reconstruction efforts, while three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models are recognized from a single photograph. Additionally, affine-invariant image patches are related to spatial relationships, and multiple images are taken from arbitrary viewpoints to enhance the robustness of the method."
