    "The innovative approach to on-line cursive handwriting analysis and recognition, described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of writing, enables successful word spotting and matching. This motor control representation quantizes cycloidal pen motion parameters without altering intelligibility, allowing for accurate recognition. The model-based method modulates slow movements to encode general pen trajectories, representing handwriting as a modulation of simple cycloidal pen motions. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of this dynamic representation in recognizing complete cursive handwriting.",
    "The study presents a general procedure for estimating and quantizing cycloidal motion parameters in cursive handwriting, applicable to arbitrary handwriting styles. This involves two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of writing, which exhibit slow modulations of amplitudes and phase lags. The result is a discrete motor control representation of continuous pen motion, achieved through the quantization of cycloidal model parameters."
