    "This paper presents research that encompasses this piece of work, which results in the resultant bilingual corpus. The resultant bilingual corpus is an authoritative and comprehensive text collection that contains 10.4 million English words and 18.3 million Chinese characters, specifically aligned at the subparagraph level. This piece of work laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting English-Chinese bitexts from the Web, which is further supported by our recent work that aligns these texts. The laws of Hong Kong are harvested from the Web to create English-Chinese bitexts, which cover the specific and special domain of HK laws. The exploration and harvesting of these bitexts can be conducted in a larger volume, utilizing the basic methodology and practical techniques reported in detail. These techniques have a broader term that encompasses the systematic approaches used in this research, which ultimately contributes to the development of a bilingual corpus valuable for empirical machine translation research.",
    "The specific and special domain of HK laws encompasses the laws of Hong Kong and is also referred to as HK laws, indicating its broader legal framework. Within this domain, Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail under the broader term methodology, which also includes Basic methodology. Furthermore, the numbering system is categorized under the legal text hierarchy, illustrating its role in organizing legal documents. Additionally, empirical MT research is a subset of both MT and methodology, highlighting its relevance in the study of machine translation methods."
