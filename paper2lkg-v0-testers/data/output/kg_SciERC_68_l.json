    "This paper describes a novel search procedure for statistical machine translation based on dynamic programming. The experimental tests carried out on the Verbmobil task demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, particularly when applied to translating German text into English with an 8000-word vocabulary in a limited-domain spoken-language setting. A key aspect of this method is the use of a search restriction that is presented as useful for the translation direction from German to English. This restriction has broader implications and can be seen as analogous to the traveling salesman problem, which involves finding the shortest possible tour that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. Starting from a DP-based solution, this approach achieves an efficient search algorithm, making it well-suited for tasks such as translating German text into English."
