    "Our method, which takes advantage of differences in word sense lexicalization between English and Chinese, as well as large amounts of available Chinese text, can be useful for automatically acquiring English topic signatures. These topic signatures are a set of words that tend to co-occur with a particular concept or word sense, used as a representation of topics in Natural Language Processing applications. We evaluated the topic signatures on a Word Sense Disambiguation task, where we trained a second-order vector cooccurrence algorithm on standard WSD datasets and achieved promising results.",
    "In this paper, we evaluated topic signatures as a set of words that tend to co-occur with a particular concept or word sense. This approach has its roots in Word Sense Disambiguation and Text Summarisation methods. Given a specific interpretation of a word or phrase, one can identify patterns or themes within text by exploiting large amounts of Chinese text available in corpora and on the Web. We present an innovative method that defines topic signatures as concise representations of topics or concepts."
