    "This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points. The proposed method, which models reflection as regions containing two different layers moving over each other, shows high detection rate with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion. This phenomenon causes many image processing techniques to fail when dealing with multiple superimposed layers or reflections. To address this issue, we present a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors, which generates sparse and dense detection maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of novel priors in generating these maps and achieving high detection rates.",
    "This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences, which can be attributed to a broader phenomenon. The occurrence of multiple layers superimposed over each other in image sequences, known as Reflections in image sequences or This phenomenon, has been observed and studied extensively. Many image processing techniques have failed when dealing with this issue due to the complexity of handling multiple reflections. To address this challenge, novel priors were developed for detecting reflections using motion trajectory analysis. The technique detects feature points by tracking their movement over time through motion estimation. A strong detector was also designed based on combining a set of weak detectors."
