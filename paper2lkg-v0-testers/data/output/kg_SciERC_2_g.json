    "A constrained optimization scheme incorporates a priori geometric constraints, which are essential in the 3-D stereo reconstruction scheme. Our approach is based on the iterative deformation of a 3-D surface mesh, a process that is integral to the reconstruction process where both structural and numerical constraints are added to enhance accuracy. Triangulations with few vertices are used for achieving satisfactory reconstruction results, and they produce these results by minimizing the objective function. The non-quadratic approach enables the attainment of satisfactory reconstruction results, particularly when combined with anisotropic meshing. Furthermore, the reconstruction results enforce consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape, ensuring that the 3-D reconstruction is both accurate and reliable.",
    "Image information alone is not sufficient to recover a 3-D shape accurately, highlighting the need for additional geometric constraints. A priori knowledge about object shape serves as a broader term that encompasses the geometric configuration of objects, which is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of 3-D reconstruction. Differential features play a significant role in 3-D reconstruction, acting as useful tools that contribute to the modeling process. The consistency of the reconstruction results is enforced by a priori knowledge about object shape, ensuring alignment with the geometric constraints. In the context of 3-D surface meshes, triangulations utilize vertices to define the geometric structure. Furthermore, the iterative deformation of a 3-D surface mesh is a computational process that minimizes an objective function, thereby refining the accuracy of the reconstructed shape."
