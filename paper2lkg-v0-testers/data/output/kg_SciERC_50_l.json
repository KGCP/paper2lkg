  "summary": "Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices , with applications in signal processing and machine learning . We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real , but we only observe a set M ' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M . Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M ' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M . The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M ' and the noise level . In particular , it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer , such as its proximity to critical points , that are typical of existing bounds in the literature .

    "This paper provides a first-ordered upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of noisy matrix perturbations and its corresponding exact joint triangularizer. The main result is an extension to jointly diagonalizable and real matrices, which are observed with noise. This problem considers the issue of estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices when they are jointly diagonalizable and real. Our main result provides a first-ordered upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of noisy matrix perturbations and its corresponding exact joint triangularizer, depending only on observable matrices in M' and noise level.",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate a first-order upper bound used to evaluate the accuracy of joint matrix triangularization methods when applied to synthetic datasets with known true values. This bound provides an important constraint on the noise level present in observed matrices M', which affects the accuracy of approximate joint matrix triangularization. Our method has proximity to critical points where the behavior of the function changes significantly, and we show that it outperforms existing bounds found in the literature."
