    "Researchers have developed two independent and relevant event-based extractive multi-document summarization approaches. The first approach, with an independent methodology, identifies important contents by frequency of events. In contrast, the second approach uses PageRank algorithm on the event map constructed from documents to identify key content. Experimental results are encouraging for both methods."
