    "The problem of reconstructing the motion of a 3D articulated tree from 2D point correspondences subject to some temporal prior has been tackled by various methods. One approach, reconstruction without estimating cameras, can be achieved by extending dynamic programming approaches to affine projection. This method yields a hard combinatorial problem with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames. To curb this complexity, branch and bound strategies have been attempted. The paper considers this problem and its broader implications for motion reconstruction."
