    "The class-oriented framework is designed for collecting paraphrase examples, which are instances of sentences that convey the same meaning using different wording. Within this framework, sentential paraphrases are collected for compositional classes of paraphrases, and similarly, paraphrase examples are also collected for these classes. Notably, compositional classes of paraphrases encompass a broader category that includes paraphrase examples. Our preliminary experiments have been instrumental in building a paraphrase corpus, yielding promising results that have been evaluated based on criteria such as reliability, exhaustiveness, and cost-efficiency. These experiments not only produced positive outcomes but also assessed the reliability and exhaustiveness of the paraphrase corpus. The promising results obtained from these experiments are evaluated according to these metrics, highlighting their significance in the context of results derived from the study."
