    "This paper presents two main contributions: a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming that encourages correct occlusion labeling, and a compact geometric derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost surface. The proposed algorithm synthesises images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position to facilitate eye contact, enabling synthesis of cyclopean views. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel algorithm for temporal maintenance of background models to enhance rendering of occlusions and reduce spatial and temporal artefacts. Our technique is based on an improved dynamic-programming stereo algorithm for efficient novel-view generation from long stereo video streams.",
    "Our technique employs an improved dynamic-programming stereo algorithm for efficient novel-view generation. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel algorithm for temporal maintenance of background models to enhance rendering of occlusions and reduce flicker artefacts. The two main contributions are: i) a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming that encourages correct occlusion labeling; ii) a compact geometric derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost surface. One-to-one teleconferencing applications use this technique to facilitate eye contact, and these demonstrations showcase synthesized cyclopean views and virtual camera translations.",
    "The concept of virtual cameras has been further demonstrated through synthesis from freely translating devices. This technique relies on a novel algorithm that acts directly on three-dimensional matching cost spaces, facilitating efficient and accurate occlusion labeling. The use of video streams acquired by two cameras highlights the importance of visual imaging in capturing and recording images or video. Furthermore, we showcase demonstrations of synthesizing images from virtual cameras that can translate freely, leveraging dynamic-programming techniques to optimize processing and reduce errors."
