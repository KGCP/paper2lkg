    "The Listen-Communicate-Show (LCS) paradigm enables tactical personnel to converse with their logistics systems using spoken language and intelligent mobile agents. This approach, demonstrated through several field exercises with the Marines, allows users to place supply or information requests and receive notifications on request status changes. The LCS-Marine system is an application of this approach that has been built by us, allowing for interactive communication between users and information sources.",
    "Tactical personnel can converse with their logistics system to place supply or information requests. This capability, which integrates spoken language understanding systems with intelligent mobile agents, enables users to interactively submit requests and receive updates on request status. The integration of these technologies allows for seamless communication between users and information sources. Additionally, the logistics system is a part of a broader technology that encompasses various systems, including databases and mobile devices."
