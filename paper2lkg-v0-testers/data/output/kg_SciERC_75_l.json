    "Weighted Approximate Rank Component Analysis proposes Weighted Approximate Rank Component Analysis -LRB- WARCA -RRB-. Our goal minimizes a weighted rank loss, which extends an efficient non-linear extension of WARCA. This new method learns a Mahalanobis distance by minimizing the loss defined on the weighted sum of precision at different ranks. The kernel trick decouples training and prediction costs from data dimensionality. We validate this new method using nine standard person re-identification datasets, including Market-1501 and CUHK03. Person re-identification is a challenging problem that requires scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithms to learn efficient non-linear extensions of WARCA.",
    "Person re-identification, a process of identifying and matching individuals across non-overlapping camera views or datasets, falls under the broader field of computer vision. Many problems in computer vision, including person re-identification, are addressed by current state-of-the-art methods. However, these methods can be improved upon using nine standard person re-identification datasets, including two large-scale Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Our new method, scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm, derives from our research."
