In this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .",

    "This paragraph discusses Another problem, which has determiners as its core concern. A logical formalism suitable for representing these determiners is proposed. In this paper, a broader term 'paper' encompasses the proposal of a logical formalism that conveys the meaning of an utterance without forcing a particular interpretation. The inherent ambiguity of determiners in Another problem can be addressed using such a logical formalism. Furthermore, it highlights the relationship between utterances and sentences, with both having broader terms like sentence."
