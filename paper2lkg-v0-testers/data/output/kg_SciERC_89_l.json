    "Utterance Verification (UV) is based on three different confidence tests, two based on acoustic measures and one founded on linguistic information. This new UV procedure presents two major features: a confidence test for decoding string hypotheses representing out-of-vocabulary words and acoustic noises, as well as another feature based on linguistic information. The ASR system is designed to deal with Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities. Confidence tests are applied to decoded string hypotheses to evaluate the accuracy of these outputs. Out-of-vocabulary words and acoustic noises have a broader term that includes acoustic noises. Experimental results from real telephone applications show an impressive 50% reduction in recognition errors, along with moderate rejection rates and low false acceptance rates."
