    "In this research, we rephrase major concepts from GB's binding theory to provide criteria for anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries. Furthermore, those approaches used for text-level anaphora incorporate an adapted version of a Grosz-Sidner-style focus model. Our unified account provides a comprehensive explanation for resolving anaphoric references both at the sentence level and across multiple sentences, all within the framework of a dependency-based grammar model."
