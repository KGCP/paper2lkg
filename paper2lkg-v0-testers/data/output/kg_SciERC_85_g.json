    "In this paper, a novel phrase-based statistical machine translation method is presented, which utilizes non-contiguous phrases, also referred to as phrases with gaps. Such phrases are generated from these phrases with gaps, and they have a broader term known as phrases. The proposed method incorporates a statistical translation model that deals with such phrases and is aimed at enhancing translation accuracy. Additionally, a method for producing such phrases from a word-aligned corpora is proposed, which facilitates the generation of phrases necessary for the translation process. This method is also proposed for producing phrases in general, highlighting its significance in the context of statistical machine translation. The phrase-based statistical machine translation method is based on non-contiguous phrases and is evaluated using a training method that maximizes translation accuracy. Overall, the statistical translation model and the proposed methods contribute to the broader field of translations, showcasing the intricate relationships between these linguistic constructs.",
    "The statistical translation model is based on the maximization of translation accuracy, which is measured using the NIST evaluation metric. A method for producing such phrases from a word-aligned corpora is proposed for producing word-aligned corpora, which are essential for effective translation processes. Translations are produced by means of a beam-search decoder, allowing for the generation of high-quality outputs. The proposed method allows for better generalization from training data, and experimental results are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness. Additionally, the training method has a broader term known as method, and it is also categorized under a training method that focuses on maximizing translation accuracy."
