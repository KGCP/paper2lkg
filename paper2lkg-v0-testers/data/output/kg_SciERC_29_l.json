    "The joint source-channel transliteration model, also known as n-gram TM, enables direct orthographical mapping between two different languages. This novel framework allows for machine transliteration and back-transliteration, which plays an important role in many multilingual speech and language applications. Our study reveals that the proposed methods can reduce extensive system development efforts while improving transliteration accuracy through several experiments. We evaluate these proposed methods to assess their impact on reducing errors and enhancing overall performance."
