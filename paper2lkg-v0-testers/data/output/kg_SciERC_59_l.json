    "While small amounts of prior knowledge can be used to learn effective models in an unsupervised fashion, many current information extraction techniques are severely limited by the need for supervised training data. In contrast, hidden Markov models provide a suitable generative model for field structured text and have been shown to attain accuracies comparable to those attained by supervised methods. Furthermore, simple prior knowledge of desired solutions can be exploited to learn effective models in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate that this approach is particularly well-suited for certain field-structured extraction tasks, such as learning from classified advertisements and bibliographic citations."
