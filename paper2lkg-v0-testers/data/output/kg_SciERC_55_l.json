    "Our experimental results show that the scheme, which comprises seven categories based on rhetorical moves of argumentation, has a broader term as an annotation scheme for scientific articles. This paper demonstrates the stability, reproducibility, and intuitiveness of this annotation scheme, with our results highlighting its applicability to various types of scientific papers."
