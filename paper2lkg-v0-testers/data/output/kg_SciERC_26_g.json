    "This paper investigates various approaches to event-based extractive multi-document summarization, which include both the relevant and independent approaches. The relevant approach identifies important contents by utilizing the PageRank algorithm, while the independent approach identifies important contents based on the frequency of events. Both approaches have a broader term, 'approaches', under which they fall. The independent approach specifically uses the frequency of events to identify important contents, which are significant data extracted from the documents. Events are defined as event terms and their associated elements, which are linked to event elements. The event map, constructed from the documents, plays a crucial role in the relevant approach, as the PageRank algorithm is applied to it to identify important contents. The experimental results of these methodologies are encouraging, indicating their effectiveness in summarizing important information from multiple documents."
