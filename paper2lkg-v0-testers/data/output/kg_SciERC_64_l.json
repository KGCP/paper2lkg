    "In this paper, we experimentally evaluate a trainable sentence planner for a spoken dialogue system by eliciting subjective human judgments. The results show that it performs better than rule-based systems and as well as hand-crafted approaches. This evaluation highlights the effectiveness of training a sentence planner to improve its performance."
