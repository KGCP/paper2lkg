    "The approximate joint triangularizer addresses the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization, which involves estimating a joint triangular representation of a set of matrices that are jointly diagonalizable, based on observed noisy versions of these matrices. A posteriori bounds for joint matrix decomposition provide a first-order upper bound on the distance between approximate and exact joint triangularizers, which is crucial for understanding the accuracy of the approximate joint triangularizer. This distance is also related to the exact joint triangularizer, highlighting the performance of the approximation. The first-order upper bound is determined by the observable matrices and the noise level, which affects the joint matrix triangularization process. The set M of matrices, which consists of jointly diagonalizable matrices, is observed as a set M' of noise-perturbed versions, complicating the estimation of their joint eigenstructure. Joint matrix triangularization is employed to estimate this joint eigenstructure, while existing bounds in the literature provide theoretical limits on the performance of these methods.",
    "Observable matrices in M ' are a specific type of observable matrices that pertain to the noise-perturbed versions of a set of jointly diagonalizable and real matrices M. This set M contains matrices that are essential for various applications, including joint matrix triangularization, which is utilized in fields such as signal processing and machine learning. The observable matrices in M ' are broader terms that encompass the general concept of matrices. Additionally, the a posteriori bound, which provides an upper limit on estimation errors, is a specific type of bounds that also relates to the broader category of matrices. The matrices in M are characterized as real, indicating that their entries are real numbers. Furthermore, the set M ' of noise perturbed versions is another broader category of matrices derived from M, which are affected by noise. The bound is particularly demonstrated on synthetic data, which serves as a benchmark for comparison against the ground truth."
