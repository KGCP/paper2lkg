    "The concept of analogies between words has been refuted by noone, citing examples such as I walked being to walk and I laughed being to laugh. This idea is further supported by experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus that estimate the number of analogies among its contained sentences. The results show two estimates: one lower and one higher, which are both considered estimates. Computational linguists seem dubious about analogies between sentences, but it's clear that there is no reality to these analogies."
