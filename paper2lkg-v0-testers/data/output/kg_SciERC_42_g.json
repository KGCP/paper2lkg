    "This research supports the results of this experiment, which assess the intelligibility of machine translation (MT) outputs. Specifically, this research evaluates the effectiveness of machine translation systems and tests the efficacy of automated evaluation techniques applied to the output of these systems. The results of this experiment will be presented alongside a preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision-making process, which were illuminating for the assessors. The first experiment in a series of experiments looks at the intelligibility of MT output, revealing how machine translation systems affect this intelligibility. The assessors made their decisions based on specific factors, which are also discussed in the results of this experiment. Overall, the findings highlight the relationship between automated evaluation techniques and the intelligibility of MT outputs, contributing to the broader understanding of evaluation techniques in the context of machine translation.",
    "Machine translation (MT) systems encompass a broader category known as machine translation systems, which are automated tools designed to translate text from one language to another. In a recent experiment, assessors made decisions regarding the intelligibility of MT output, which is a specific type of machine translation output. The subjects of the study were tasked with determining whether the sample output they evaluated was produced by expert human translators or was simply machine translation. They were given three minutes per extract to assess the translated newswire text, which consisted of various extracts. The first experiment in a series focused on evaluating MT output, utilizing evaluation techniques that provide insights into the development of machine translation systems and the translation process. The factors on which the assessors made their decisions included criteria that allowed them to differentiate between non-native and native language essays, showcasing their ability to evaluate the quality of translations effectively.",
    "A preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision-making process highlights the various factors that influence how subjects differentiate between expert human translations and machine translation outputs. In this context, evaluation techniques, originally devised for the evaluation of human language learners, will provide information about the human language learning process. Subjects were given a set of up to six extracts of translated newswire text, which they evaluated to determine if the sample output was indeed expert human translations. The results of this experiment contribute to understanding the intelligibility of MT output, which is a broader term encompassing the development of machine translation systems. Furthermore, the intelligibility of MT output is assessed through automated evaluation techniques, ensuring that the translation process is effectively analyzed.",
    "Machine translation encompasses a variety of systems, including those referred to as MT, which are designed to automate the translation process. Within this field, the first experiment in a series of experiments specifically examines the intelligibility of machine translation outputs. This experiment is part of a broader category of experiments aimed at understanding the decision making process involved in evaluating translations. The intelligibility assessment compares expert human translations to MT output, focusing on the factors that influence assessors' decisions. Additionally, this research falls under the larger umbrella of research, which includes various studies such as language learning experiments that investigate the human language learning process and its relation to human language learners."
