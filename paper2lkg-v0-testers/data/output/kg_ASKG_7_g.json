  "summary": "Wikidata has become one of the most prominent open knowledge graphs (KGs) on the Web. Relying on a community of users with different expertise, this cross-domain KG is directly related to other data sources. This paper investigates how Wikidata is linked to other data sources in the Linked Data ecosystem.\n\nTo this end, we adapt previous definitions of ontology links and instance links to the terminological part of the Wikidata vocabulary and perform an analysis of the links in Wikidata to external datasets and ontologies from the Linked Data ecosystem. As a side effect, this reveals insights on the ontological expressiveness of meta-properties used in Wikidata.\n\nThe results of this analysis show that while Wikidata defines a large number of individuals, classes and properties within its own namespace, they are not yet extensively linked. We discuss reasons for this and conclude with some suggestions to increase the interconnectedness of Wikidata with other KGs.\n\nWikidata, a multilingual knowledge graph launched in 2012, contains over 95 million entities and is built collaboratively by editors and bots using the Wikibase software. It integrates external datasets through links, allowing automatic updates, such as citation numbers via bots. This paper aims to study the linkage of Wikidata with other knowledge graphs (KGs) by adapting existing definitions of ontology and instance links to the Wikidata model. The analysis of the HDT dump from March 2021 reveals that Wikidata's ontology is community-developed rather than strictly adhering to RDFS/OWL semantics, leading to semantic inconsistencies that are often resolved through editor discussions. The study proposes hypotheses regarding Wikidata's role as a central hub in the Linked Data ecosystem, focusing on its use of its own namespace for entities, the ratio of internal to external links, and the nature of its instance links. The paper is structured to discuss the ontology in Wikidata, the methodology for analyzing link types, results, related work, and conclusions.\n\nWikidata utilizes a minimal predefined schema from Wikibase to describe entities, focusing on internal and external links rather than the Wikibase meta-model. Its vocabulary is collaboratively developed, resembling RDFS/OWL properties, but does not strictly adhere to their semantics. This section discusses the meta-modelling classes and relations in Wikidata, mapping them to RDFS/OWL for link analysis. Wikidata differentiates between classes (e.g., person) and instances (e.g., Barack Obama), with a top-level class hierarchy. It includes first-order and second-order classes, with metaclasses defined. While instances can also be subclasses, this can lead to non-intuitive hierarchies. The only consistent assumption is that all items are instances of the entity class, similar to rdfs:Resource in RDF.\n\nWikidata properties utilize RDF properties to represent both binary relations and atomic value attributes, allowing for item-property-value triples where values can be items or literals. Each statement can be qualified with additional information. Properties have their own Wikidata pages and use identifiers starting with 'P', reusing some RDFS/OWL properties for defining statements about pages. Unlike other RDF knowledge graphs, Wikidata's terminological properties share the same namespace as properties describing entities. Wikidata introduces properties like 'subproperty of' (P1647) to describe hierarchical relations among properties, but these are not linked to external vocabularies. Domain and range properties are defined using qualified property constraints (P2302), with skolemized IRIs for type and value-type constraints. Equivalence between properties is stated with 'equivalent property' (P1628), but disjointness cannot be defined. Wikidata lacks support for property chain axioms and negative property assertions, using property constraints to define restrictions instead.\n\nThis text outlines the definition of link types in the Wikidata data model based on RDF-S/OWL correspondences. It discusses the establishment of authoritative namespace URIs from other Knowledge Graphs, utilizing a dataset corpus that includes 431 Linked Datasets totaling 104 GB. The analysis distinguishes between Ontology (TBox) Links and Instance (ABox) Links, with Ontology Links further categorized into class links, instance typing links, property links, and instance role links. SPARQL queries are provided to retrieve these link types, including external classes and properties, and to compute Instance Links from Wikidata to external namespaces. The process involves checking occurrences of classes and properties in the knowledge graph to quantify the links.\n\nThis report discusses the link analysis results of Wikidata, conducted on a machine with 8 vCPUs and 380 GB RAM. It highlights that the ratio of unique subjects to predicates in Wikidata is 1 to 41810, compared to 1 to 3900 in the Linked Open Data (LOD) corpus. Wikidata contains 1.69 billion triples, significantly larger than DBpedia's 1.04 billion, indicating that predicate growth in KGs follows an asymptotic function. Wikidata defines 89 million unique individuals using its own ontology, surpassing the 73 million claimed unique entities. Each unique entity typically has about 18 related entities in its subgraph. For instance, Barack Obama has 394 skolemized IRIs detailing his education. Key statistics include 1,693,668,039 triples, 1,625,057,179 unique subjects, 38,867 predicates, and 89,120,227 unique individuals.\n\nThis analysis presents statistics on classes and properties in Wikidata, distinguishing between declared and undeclared classes. All 2,522,595 unique classes in Wikidata are undeclared, while properties are declared with owl:DatatypeProperty and owl:ObjectProperty types, totaling 74,309 declared properties as of March 2021. Wikidata has only 3,955 class links, resulting in a low ratio of 0.0015 class links per class, compared to an average of 11.27 in other datasets. This low ratio is attributed to instances being defined as classes and limitations in the user interface. The hypothesis that Wikidata should have more class links is rejected. Similarly, there are only 835 property links, averaging 0.01 per property, leading to the rejection of the hypothesis that Wikidata has more property links than other datasets. The low property link ratio is due to recent additions of properties designed for external linking. Additionally, there are no instance typing links using the instance of relation, confirming the hypothesis that Wikidata types all entities using its own ontology.\n\nWikidata has 173 million links to entities in other knowledge graphs, representing 10.22% of its triples, but the link ratio of 1.94 is lower than the Linked Open Data ecosystem's 8.6, leading to the rejection of hypothesis H4.1. Many links point to Wikipedia, which are not RDF resources. A sample of 1,924,940 instance links was analyzed, revealing that most point to non-RDF resources, rejecting hypothesis H4.2, although a quarter are RDF resources. Wikidata should classify links based on target formats. In testing hypothesis 5, no instance links used the owl:sameAs relation, and only 3.7% used the exact match relation with external namespaces. Thus, hypothesis 5 is also rejected. Overall, Wikidata has a higher ratio of class and property links compared to the Linked Open Data ecosystem, does not use external ontology classes for typing entities, and most instance links lead to RDF Web resources.\n\nVarious studies analyze quality aspects of Wikidata. Erxleben et al. connect Wikidata to the Linked Data Web using RDF exports and identify problematic classifications. F\u00e4rber et al. survey open KGs, including Wikidata, while Freire and Isaac assess its machine interpretation alignment with RDF/S, OWL, SKOS, and schema.org. Piscopo and Simperl review 28 papers on data quality in Wikidata, focusing on completeness and tools addressing quality. Pillai et al. compare Wikidata with other KGs on completeness, timeliness, and accessibility. Abian et al. discover inconsistent temporal data through cross-comparing date values. Piscopo and Simperl also propose a framework to evaluate the evolving Wikidata ontology based on user roles. Samuel introduces the WDProp tool for multi-language aspects of Wikidata properties, and Shenoy et al. focus on correctness. However, none of these studies analyze Wikidata's interlinking and centrality in the LOD ecosystem, which is the focus of this paper.\n\nWe have analysed the number and types of links in Wikidata to evaluate how central Wikidata is to the Linked Open Data ecosystem. While Wikidata is the largest, most comprehensive general knowledge knowledge graph on the Web, using a comprehensive, bottom-up developed ontology that is used to type its many entities, it is not yet serving as a central hub for linked data on the Web.\n\nFor its relative lack of instance links, this means that either the Wikidata editors deem such links as obsolete, or that these links are yet to be included, or that they already exist, but rather as incoming links from the external dataset to Wikidata. However, as a bottom-up created knowledge graph, there is the possibility for anyone who owns a dataset to actually create an outgoing link in the Wikidata namespace to the dataset they own. Many bots have been created for exactly this reason, automatically creating outgoing links from Wikidata to other datasets, and they improve the discoverability and visibility of the external dataset. Every dataset publisher, for their own benefit, should therefore consider creating those outgoing links in the Wikidata knowledge graph.\n\nComparatively, for its size, Wikidata also includes less ontology links than other datasets in the Linked Open Data ecosystem. While this can be partially explained by the fact that many individuals defined in Wikidata are also classes, skewing the ratio between classes and class links, this does not apply to property links, where there is no such distinction. Most properties in Wikidata are not linked to external properties at all, even though specific properties exist in the Wikidata ontology to do so.\n\nWhile we have suggested in this paper that some changes to the user interface of Wikibase may encourage editors to provide more such links, a fundamental rethink of ontology design may have to occur too. Specifically, common best practice in ontology engineering is to include links from an ontology to other ontologies through import statements or URI reuse. However, in the case of the Wikidata ontology, the developers of domain ontologies should consider creating those links to their ontologies in the Wikidata namespace, rather than in the other direction.\n\nWikidata also does not yet provide many equivalence or weaker forms of likeness relations from its entities to external entities. There is an onus on the Wikidata editor community to ensure that such links are increasingly provided, given that Wikidata should generally not be the authoritative source of entities, but link to an authoritative representation of an entity through, for example, the exact match relation in Wikidata. However, the lack of such links may also be an indication that entities defined in Wikidata do not yet exist or never will exist in the Linked Open Data ecosystem.\n\nAs future works, we first would like to analyse the evolution of links on Wikidata over time using several historical snapshots of the published Wikidata HDT files. Also, a deeper analysis of the entities that are linked, such as what are the top-ranked instance and ontology namespaces referenced from Wikidata, is planned for future work.",
