    "Utterance Verification (UV) is a method for the UV procedure, which is also referred to as UV. This paper presents the UV procedure, a critical function of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The UV procedure is based on three different confidence tests and features confidence tests as well as decoded string hypotheses. The ASR system, which encompasses the broader term ASR, is designed to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and operates in real applications. Experimental results demonstrate the rejection rate of correct utterances and recognition errors, highlighting the effectiveness of the UV procedure in improving ASR performance. Additionally, the ASR system possesses Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities, which are essential for distinguishing between speech and acoustic noise.",
    "The ASR system, which is a broader term for Automatic Speech Recognition, is specifically designed to handle Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities. This system works on acoustic noises, which are a type of noise that can interfere with speech recognition. To manage these challenges, word and garbage models are employed to represent both noises and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Decoded string hypotheses, which are the outputs of the ASR system, are obtained using these models. Experimental results indicate issues such as false acceptance, highlighting the importance of confidence tests that are applied to these decoded string hypotheses. Furthermore, three different confidence tests are based on acoustic measures and founded on linguistic information, enhancing the system's accuracy. The telephone application utilizes the ASR system for a natural number recognition task, demonstrating its capability to work with spontaneous speech."
