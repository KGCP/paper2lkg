    "This paper presents a novel search procedure for statistical machine translation, which includes the application of a search restriction that is particularly useful for the translation direction from German to English. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task, a limited-domain spoken-language task that utilizes an 8000-word vocabulary. Within this context, the novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering achieves an efficient search algorithm, enhancing the overall translation process. The search procedure for statistical machine translation is based on dynamic programming and is related to the DP-based solution, which itself is derived from the traveling salesman problem. Overall, the Verbmobil task exemplifies the integration of these advanced techniques in the field of German-English translation."
