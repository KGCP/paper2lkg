    "This paper describes the generating process of speech F0 contours, addressing the problem of generating the fundamental frequency (F0) contour of speech from text input for text-to-speech synthesis. It proposes extending this model, which is based on the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model, to include a context-dependent one. The paper also introduces a parameter training algorithm that facilitates the estimation of the present model's parameters. The generating process of speech F0 contours encompasses broader terms such as raw F0 contours and F0 itself, while the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model is a specific instance of the broader Fujisaki model. Additionally, the model described in this paper allows for the derivation of an efficient algorithm that enhances the accuracy of parameter estimation from raw F0 contours.",
    "This model allows to derive an efficient algorithm that utilizes powerful statistical methods for estimating the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours. The Fujisaki-model parameters, which are essential for modeling the fundamental frequency (F0) contours in speech, are estimated from these raw F0 contours. Additionally, the present model is based on decision tree-based context clustering, which is also the foundation for the parameter training algorithm. The problem of generating the fundamental frequency contour of speech involves speech and relates to the broader context of text-to-speech synthesis, where the generation process of speech F0 contours plays a crucial role. Furthermore, both the context-dependent model and the Fujisaki model have broader terms that encompass the general concept of models used in text-to-speech synthesis.",
    "An efficient algorithm is based on powerful statistical methods, which are advanced analytical techniques used in the field of speech synthesis. The problem of generating the fundamental frequency (F0) contour of speech from a text input for text-to-speech synthesis involves the use of text input as a crucial component. The Fujisaki model, a statistical model that describes the generation of F0 contours, has a broader term that encompasses statistical models in general. Similarly, the model used for generating F0 contours also falls under the broader category of statistical models and algorithms. The parameter training algorithm, which is a method for estimating parameters in the context-dependent Fujisaki model, is classified as an algorithm as well. Additionally, the Fujisaki-model parameters are associated with the text input, highlighting the relationship between the input data and the model's parameters. Decision tree-based context clustering, another algorithm, is utilized to enhance the efficiency of parameter training in generating F0 contours from text input. Overall, these relationships illustrate the interconnectedness of algorithms, statistical methods, and the challenges faced in speech synthesis."
