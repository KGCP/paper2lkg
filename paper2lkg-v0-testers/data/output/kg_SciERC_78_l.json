    "MINPRAN, a robust operator for handling large outlier percentages in data sets, assumes 'the bad data' and finds accurate transformations and nearly correct numbers of inliers. It has properties that compare favorably to least median of squares. MINPRAN also distinguishes between time series from actual data and random data. The algorithm uses random sampling to search for the threshold value or parameter used by its random sampling algorithm, which handles large outlier percentages. Additionally, MINPRAN applies to complex range and intensity data, a collection of numerical values representing a range of intensities. Furthermore, it has been applied in related work on applications of the MINPRAN robust operator to such data."
