    "This work proposes a new research direction that can model speech syntax without relying on any annotated training corpus. It is based on a weakly supervised dependency parser, which models speech syntax by analyzing sentence structure and relationships between words. The lack of structures in traditional n-gram models has been addressed through this approach. A novel approach to addressing the limitations of traditional n-gram models proposes a new research direction that can model speech syntax without relying on annotated training corpora. This work is based on a weakly supervised dependency parser, which analyzes sentence structure and relationships between words."
