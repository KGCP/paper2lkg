    "This paper describes a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames, which uses a decision-tree classifier to detect grammatical relations and classify them into hierarchical frames. The system incorporates a powerful pattern-matching language that enables efficient classification of phrases into specific grammatical categories. Experiments show that the system is able to detect scf types with 70% precision and 66% recall rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames from English corpus data. Furthermore, this new tool for linguistic annotation can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition.",
    "The pattern-matching language and statistical parser are both types of tools used for linguistic processing. The pattern-matching language has a broader term, which is tool, indicating that it falls under this category. Similarly, the statistical parser also has a broader term, which is again tool, suggesting its connection to other linguistic processing tools."
