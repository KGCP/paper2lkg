    "Language resource quality significantly affects the impact of using different-quality references, which in turn has implications for evaluation in natural language processing (NLP). This paper describes how varying quality in reference data can influence evaluation outcomes, emphasizing that both language resource quality and different-quality references are broader terms encompassing quality and resources. The validation of these resources is widely recommended before their use, as they are derived from data created by human beings. Furthermore, high-quality data is essential in NLP, as it is a critical component of resources and evaluation methods, including automatic evaluations. However, the limitations of the automatic metrics are discussed in the context of machine translation (MT), highlighting the need for careful consideration of reference quality.",
    "The limitations of the automatic metrics are discussed in regard to MT, highlighting the challenges faced when relying on automated evaluation methods. In this context, data created by human beings serves as a broader term for data, which is essential for various tasks in natural language processing. Additionally, the impact of using different-quality references is significant, as it has a broader term of references, which encompasses both different-quality references and reference translations. These references are crucial for evaluating machine translation systems. Furthermore, the NLP context, which has a broader term of NLP, emphasizes the importance of high-quality data, as automatic evaluations need such data to ensure accurate assessments. The validation of these resources, a process that falls under the broader term of validation, is vital for confirming the reliability of language resources before their application. Overall, human beings are the creators of data, and human translations represent a broader category that includes the work of these individuals."
