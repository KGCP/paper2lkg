    "Our preliminary experiments on building a paraphrase corpus have been producing promising results, which are evaluated according to cost-efficiency, exhaustiveness, and reliability. This research has examined a class-oriented framework for collecting paraphrase examples, where sentential paraphrases are collected separately by means of automatic candidate generation and manual judgement. Our initial findings build upon experiments that aim to conduct deep analysis of compositional classes of paraphrases."
