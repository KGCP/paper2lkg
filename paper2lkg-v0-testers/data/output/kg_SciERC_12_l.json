    "In computer vision, trifocal tensors provide a mathematical representation of projective relations connecting points and lines across three views. This specialization of known projective relations gives rise to an affine case where transformations are reduced to linear ones. The trifocal tensor has a simple geometric interpretation in the context of affine cameras. Furthermore, trifocal tensors can be specialized to relate registered tensors from previous work, providing a broader understanding of their structure and relationships. In addition, bifo-cal and projective unifocal tensors also specialize to this affine case, offering insights into the connections between multiple views."
