    "This paper proposes a novel approach to online human action detection from streaming skeleton data. The proposed model, which combines joint classification-regression optimization, automatically localizes and forecasts actions more accurately than previous methods. This network has been designed to capture complex long-range temporal dynamics, allowing it to efficiently process temporal data. Our dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on both our own annotations and publicly available datasets like G3D. The study of human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data goes one step further in understanding human actions.",
    "The 'streaming skeleton data' and 'a large streaming video dataset with annotations' are both types of datasets. The 'Online action detection' problem involves identifying actions in real-time video streams, which can be addressed using 3D skeleton data as input for computer vision or machine learning algorithms. Similarly, the 'the problem of online action detection' is a challenge that requires addressing this issue. These datasets and problems are all related to each other through their broader terms."
