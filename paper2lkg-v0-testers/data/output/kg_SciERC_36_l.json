    "The problem of computing involves calculating the Kullback-Leibler distance, also known as relative entropy. This concept measures the difference between two probability distributions and has a solution for the cross-entropy, which represents a specific part of this distance. The Kullback-Leibler distance is also referred to as relative entropy. Probabilistic context-free grammars have been approximated by probabilistic finite automata, with both models recognizing patterns in strings of symbols using probability theory."
