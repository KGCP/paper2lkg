    "For non-LR grammars, our algorithm is implemented as memo-functions, memorizing previous invocations. This purely functional implementation provides a simple correctness proof and gives LR-parsers. Our algorithm is closely related to recursive ascent parsers, which has a broader term parser. A generalization of the recursive descent parser also falls under this category. Additionally, Kruse-man Aretz recently discovered by Roberts, who are known for their work in linguistics and grammar."
