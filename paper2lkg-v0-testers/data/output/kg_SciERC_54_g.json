    "This paper describes FERRET, which is an interactive question-answering system. FERRET is categorized as a system and has broader terms that include both system and interactive question-answering. The interactive question-answering framework of FERRET is designed to enhance user interaction through predictive questioning, which attempts to identify the answers users need. Users interact with this system to gather information related to a particular scenario, which itself is a specific context that falls under the broader term scenario. Additionally, automatic Q/A applications, which are also broader terms for Q/A, are integrated into this framework to facilitate the answering of user queries."
