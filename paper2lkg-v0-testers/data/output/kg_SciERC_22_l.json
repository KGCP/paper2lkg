    "This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank. We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon consistent with CCG principles, which are induced by a smaller treebank compared to Penn WSJ. The output is a lexical resource that adheres to CCG principles and represents the grammatical structure of Turkish language in terms of dependencies between words."
