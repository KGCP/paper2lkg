    "In this work, we study how distributed representations within CNNs represent object pose information and how this contradicts with object category representations. We investigate the layers of various CNN models to understand their role in capturing pose information over different categories of objects. Our research question or goal is to discover how these layers represent object pose information and contrast it with that for object categories. To achieve this, we analyze the layers of distributed representations within CNNs, focusing on how they capture pose information and categorize objects. We experiment on two recent large and challenging multi-view datasets to validate our findings.",
    "Recent advancements in object pose estimation have focused on developing view-invariant representations that can capture pose information over different categories of objects. These approaches, which include deep learning methods and distributed representations, have achieved wide success in this task. The state-of-the-art has been pushed forward by the use of two recent large and challenging multi-view datasets. Moreover, these datasets have enabled researchers to develop more sophisticated architectures that can handle complex object categorization tasks."
