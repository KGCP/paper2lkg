    "This paper investigates the discrepancies between the emotional assessments of naive listeners and the self-assessments of the speakers that generated the data, focusing on the emotional assessments provided by the speakers in the IEMOCAP database. It analyzes the mismatch between the expression and perception of emotion, as well as the validity of the assumption that listeners' perceptions closely align with the intended emotions conveyed by the speakers. Notably, the speakers in the database are the same as the speakers that generated the data, and both groups assess the mismatches between their emotional evaluations. The IEMOCAP database plays a crucial role in comparing and evaluating emotional assessments, including both discrete (categorical) and continuous (attribute-based) evaluations. Furthermore, the mismatches between the assessments are categorized under the broader term 'mismatches', which highlights the discrepancies in emotional evaluations made by naive listeners and the self-assessments of the speakers.",
    "The validity of this assumption is a broader term for the assumption that listeners accurately perceive the emotions intended by speakers in expressive speech communication. Emotional assessments, which include discrete (categorical) and continuous (attribute-based) evaluations, are conducted by naive listeners to analyze the emotional expressions conveyed by speakers. The results of the study indicate a significant mismatch between the expression and perception of emotion, highlighting the discrepancies in emotional assessments. These mismatches are particularly evident when comparing the emotion perceived by the listener to the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker. The analysis is based on the hypothesis that people are better decoders of their own emotions, suggesting that individuals may more accurately interpret their own emotional states compared to those perceived by others. This paper explores these concepts further, contributing to the understanding of emotional categories and the broader implications of expression and perception in communication.",
    "Self-assessments are closely aligned with the intended emotions that speakers aim to convey, suggesting that individuals are often better at evaluating their own emotional states. The emotion perceived by the listener is a broader concept that encompasses various types of emotions, while the activation-valence space serves as a framework for understanding these emotions in terms of their intensity and pleasantness. Self-assessments fall under the broader category of assessments, which also includes discrete and continuous emotional evaluations. More specific emotional categories contribute to the identification of more extreme values in the activation-valence space, enhancing the precision of emotional expression. The intended emotion conveyed by the speaker, along with their own emotions, is categorized under the general term emotion, which is further explored through the hypothesis that individuals are superior decoders of their own emotional experiences. The speakers in the IEMOCAP database provide valuable insights into these dynamics, as the results of studies reveal significant discrepancies between expressed emotions and those perceived by listeners."
