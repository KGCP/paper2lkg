In this paper , we present methods by which an agent learns action models from its own experience and from its observation of a domain expert . These methods diier from previous work in the area in two ways : the use of an action model formalism which is better suited to the needs of a re-active agent , and successful implementation of noise-handling mechanisms . Training instances are generated from experience and observation , and a variant of GOLEM is used to learn action models from these instances .

    "In this paper, we present methods by which an agent learns action models from its own experience and observation of a domain expert. This approach differs from previous work in the area as it uses an action model formalism and noise-handling mechanisms to validate action model learning in simulated environments such as construction and oceanic domains. The integrated learning system has been experimentally validated in these domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method for autonomous agents. Furthermore, we show that using an action model formalism is better suited to reactive planning systems like a re-active agent. Overall, our methods provide a framework for domain-specific models of actions learned and utilized by planning systems."
