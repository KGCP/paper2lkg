    "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of a prototype natural language question answering system known as Chat-80. Chat-80 is designed to efficiently translate English questions into the Prolog form, which is executed to yield answers. The system, which is implemented entirely in Prolog, is characterized by its efficiency and adaptability to a variety of applications. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes that the prototype natural language question answering system has a broader term, referred to simply as 'system', which encompasses various applications. The logical expressions generated from English questions are processed within the Prolog subset of logic, highlighting the relationship between natural language inquiries and formal logic.",
    "The Prolog subset of logic is a specific category within the broader term Prolog, which is a programming language based on formal logic. This subset, along with efficient Prolog, also falls under the umbrella of programming languages. The Prolog form, which is a logical expression generated from natural language questions, is categorized as a programming language as well. Prolog itself is recognized as a programming language that is fundamentally based on logic. The resulting logical expression, which is a formal representation of a natural language question, is a type of logical expression that is transformed by a planning algorithm. Additionally, query optimisation in a relational database is a specialized area that has broader terms including query optimisation and relational database, with query optimisation involving the relational database."
