    "The relationship between the two grammatical formalisms examines the two formalisms, which include Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars. This relationship involves both Head Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars, as they are compared in terms of their weak equivalence. The weak equivalence of the two formalisms investigates their ability to generate the same set of strings under certain conditions, highlighting their comparative capabilities. Furthermore, the two formalisms have a broader term known as formalisms, which encompasses both frameworks. A discussion turns to the two formalisms, focusing on their linguistic expressiveness, which also has a broader term that refers to linguistic expressiveness in general. In this context, Tree Adjoining Grammars compare with Head Grammars, examining their relationship and investigating their expressive power."
