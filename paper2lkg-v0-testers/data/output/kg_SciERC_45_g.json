    "The automated technique is designed to detect reflections in image sequences, which are a complex visual phenomenon characterized by the presence of multiple overlapping layers. This phenomenon is further defined by regions containing two different layers that model reflections, complicating image processing tasks. This work presents both the automated technique and a strong detector, which enhances detection capabilities by integrating multiple weak detectors. The automated technique analyzes the motion trajectories of feature points to effectively identify these reflections. Reflections in image sequences consist of several layers, where regions containing two different layers are moving over each other, creating challenges for motion estimation and object recognition. Additionally, pathological motion and occlusion are broader terms that describe related phenomena affecting image processing.",
    "The strong detector is an advanced mechanism that is based on combining weak detectors to enhance the detection of reflections in image sequences. This detection process involves analyzing the motion trajectories of feature points, which are distinct locations in an image that help in identifying overlapping layers caused by reflections. These overlapping components, referred to as several layers, complicate image processing tasks, as they introduce complexity beyond the assumption of a single layer. To improve detection performance, novel priors generate sparse and dense detection maps, which visually represent the data and enhance the identification of these reflections. The phenomenon of reflections in image sequences poses challenges for image processing techniques, particularly in motion estimation and object recognition, as they often fail due to the assumption of a single layer. However, the proposed technique demonstrates a high detection rate, effectively rejecting issues related to pathological motion and occlusion, thereby improving the overall performance in detecting reflections."
