    "Verbal and nonverbal grounding acts are essential components of nonverbal grounding acts, which are utilized by embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to enhance communication. ECAs employ both verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to effectively update the dialogue state, thereby facilitating smoother human-computer interactions. These agents rely on verbal and nonverbal means for grounding to establish common ground, which is crucial for mutual understanding. Nonverbal behaviors, such as head nods and eye gaze, play a significant role in this process. Head nods, a type of nonverbal behavior, are analyzed in the context of direction-giving tasks and are categorized under the broader term of signals. Similarly, eye gaze is also examined within direction-giving tasks and is classified as a nonverbal means. Both head nods and eye gaze contribute to establishing common ground and differ depending on the type of dialogue move being employed. Overall, the interplay of these verbal and nonverbal means is vital for effective communication in human-computer interaction.",
    "In the realm of human-computer interaction, attentional focus is a cognitive process that has a broader term encompassing signals, which include both verbal and nonverbal cues. This attentional focus is analyzed in the context of a direction-giving task, where it plays a crucial role in understanding how participants communicate. Additionally, the type of dialogue move, which refers to specific communicative actions, is a broader category under the dialogue move concept. Embodied conversational agents, which simulate human-like interaction, also fall under the broader term of human-computer interaction. The overall pattern observed during these interactions is reflected in the lack of negative feedback, indicating a systematic monitoring of nonverbal behaviors, which are also encompassed by the broader terms of nonverbal behaviors and nonverbal means."
